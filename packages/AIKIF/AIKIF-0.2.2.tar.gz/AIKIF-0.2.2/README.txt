AIKIF - Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Information Framework

This is an information classification framework that maps structured or freeform data to 
a standard knowledge store.

Manages a dataset of your applications, the source data, parameters, runs and results and then uses your business rules to convert and store the information in a machine usable format.

Your AI software can link to AIKIF by setting up logging watch-points to define success / 
failure along with the range of input parameters. Goals and plans are defined by breaking 
them down to smaller tasks until the task can be run by a tool in the Toolbox.

A tool is any python wrapped function or application and is easily extensible.
