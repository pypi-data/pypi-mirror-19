This package contains a set of persistent object containers built around
a modified BTree data structure.  The trees are optimized for use inside
ZODB's "optimistic concurrency" paradigm, and include explicit resolution
of conflicts detected by that mechanism.

Please see `the Sphinx documentation <http://btrees.readthedocs.io/>`_ for further
information.
