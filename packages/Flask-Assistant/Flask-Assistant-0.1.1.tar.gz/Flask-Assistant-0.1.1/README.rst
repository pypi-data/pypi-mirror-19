Create Virtual Assistants with Python
===============================================


A flask extension serving as an `API.AI`_  SDK to provide an easy way to create virtual assistants which may be integrated with platforms such as `Google Actions`_ (Google Home).

.. _`Google Actions`: https://developers.google.com/actions/develop/apiai/ 
.. _`fullfillment`: https://developers.google.com/actions/develop/apiai/dialogs-and-fulfillment#overview
.. _API.AI: https://docs.api.ai/

Flask-Assistant allow you to focus on building the webhook fullfillment_ of actions invoked by the user and desgin a conversational flow to build contextual dialogues.

 This project is heavily inspired and based on John Wheeler's `Flask-ask <https://github.com/johnwheeler/flask-ask>`_ for the Alexa Skills Kit.


Features
---------
    - Mapping of user-triggered Intents to action functions
    - Context support for crafting dialogue dependent on the user's requests
    - Define prompts for missing parameters when they are not present in the users request or past active contexs
    - A convenient syntax resembling Flask's decoratored routing
    - Internal API.AI schema generation and registration
      


Hello World
------------

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import Flask
    from flask_assistant import Assistant, tell

    app = Flask(__name__)
    assist = Assistant(app)

    @assist.action('Demo')
    def hello_world():
        speech = 'Microphone check 1, 2 what is this?'
        return tell(speech)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)

How-To
-------

    1. Create an `Assistant` object with a Flask app and the route to your webhook URL.
    2. Use `action` decorators to map the intents to the proper action function.
    3. Use action view functions to return `ask` or `tell` responses.
