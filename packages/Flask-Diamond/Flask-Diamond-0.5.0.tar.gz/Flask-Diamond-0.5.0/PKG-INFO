Description: Flask-Diamond
        =============
        
        **Flask-Diamond** offers some opinions about network information systems that process data.
        **Flask-Diamond** is a batteries-included Python Flask framework, sortof like Django but radically decomposable.
        Using **Flask-Diamond**, you can scaffold a working application with sensible defaults, then easily override those defaults to meet your own goals.
        **Flask-Diamond** provides a shared vocabulary that helps teams coordinate as they scale up to develop multiple Flask applications while maintaining good code reuse and learning transfer.
        **Flask-Diamond** goes beyond a "project scaffold" by providing a complete architecture and team solution, including documentation, tutorials, and other learning support.
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        A Flask-Diamond application consists of *facets*, which are common facilities that many applications eventually need to provide.
        The *facets* provided by Flask-Diamond include:
        
        - account management
        - administrative access
        - databases
        - Model object CRUD
        - email
        - testing
        - documentation
        - deployment
        - and more
        
        Usage
        ^^^^^
        
        The following steps will create a new Flask-Diamond application.
        
        ::
        
            pip install Flask-Diamond
            mkdir my-application
            cd my-application
            flask-diamond scaffold app
            make install docs test db server
