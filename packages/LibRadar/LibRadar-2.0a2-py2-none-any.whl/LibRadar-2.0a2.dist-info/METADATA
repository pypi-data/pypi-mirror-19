===================
LibRadar
===================
LibRadar is an automatic tool for Android library detection.

-------------------
Features
-------------------

 - Fast
LibRadar takes just several seconds to scan an app and report the list of third-party libraries used in it.
 - Accurate
LibRadar is trained with more than 1 million apps from Google Play, so it can identify virtually all popular libraries in any given Android app.
 - Anti-Obfuscation
Many Android apps are obfuscated with tools such as ProGuard, which makes it difficult to recognize a library by its package names or class names.
LibRadar is obfuscation-resilient since we use features that cannot be obfuscated, such as statistics on Android APIs.
