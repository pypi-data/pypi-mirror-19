MapProxy is an open source proxy for geospatial data. It caches, accelerates and transforms data from existing map services and serves any desktop or web GIS client.

MapProxy is a tile cache, but also offers many new and innovative features like full support for WMS clients.

MapProxy is actively developed and supported by `Omniscale <http://omniscale.com>`_, it is released under the Apache Software License 2.0, runs on Unix/Linux and Windows and is easy to install and to configure.

Changes
-------
1.9.1 2017-01-18
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixes:

- serve-develop: fixed reloader for Windows installations made
  with recent pip version (#279)

1.9.0 2016-07-22
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements:

- New band merge feature. Allows to create false-color or grayscale
  images on the fly.
- Support for ArcGIS REST sources.
- Support multiple tilesets for each WMTS layer with the new
  tile_sources option.
- Allow to build WMS images from SQLite cache with more then 330 tiles.
- New `arcgis` cache layout. Compatible to ArcGIS exploded caches.
- New `mp` cache layout. Reduces number of nested directories.
- Prevent unneeded quantizing/re-encoding of images.
- Demo client: Support custom tile_size.

Fixes:

- Fix quantization error for some image modes
  (e.g. grayscale image with transparency)
- Support custom Proj4/EPSG files in mapproxy-util grid.
- Convert paletted images to RGB(A) to avoid NEAREST resampling.
- Fix quantizing with FASTOCTREE for paletted images with alpha channel.
- Keep configured layer order in WMTS capabilities.
- Fix coverage loading with Python 3.

Other:

- Make the output of various utils more clear.
- wms.md.title is no longer required, default to "MapProxy WMS".

1.8.2 2016-01-22
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixes:

- serve-develop: fixed reloader for Windows installations made
  with recent pip version

1.8.1 2015-09-22
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements:

- WMS 1.3.0: support for metadata required by INSPIRE View Services
- WMS: OnlineResource defaults to service URL

Fixes:

- mapproxy-seed: fix race-condition which prevented termination at the
  end of the seeding process
- autoconfig: parse capabilities without ContactInformation
- SQLite cache: close files after seeding
- sqlite/mbtiles: fix tile lock location
- WMS 1.0.0: fix image format for source requests
- WMS: allow floats for X/Y in GetFeatureInfo requests
- CouchDB: fix for Python 3

Other:

- mapproxy-seed: seeding a cache with disable_storage: true returns
  an error
- all changes are now tested against Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5

1.8.0 2015-05-18
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Features:

- Support for Python 3.3 or newer

Improvements:

- WMS is now available at /service, /ows and /wms
- WMTS KVP is now available at /service and /ows, RESTful service at /wmts
- allow tiled access to layers with multiple map:false sources
- add Access-control-allow-origin header to HTTP responses
- list KVP and RESTful capabilities on demo page
- disable verbose seed output if stdout is not a tty
- add globals.cache.link_single_color_images option
- support scale_factor for Mapnik sources

Fixes:

- handle EPSG axis order in WMTS capabilities
- pass through legends/featureinfo for recursive caches
- accept PNG/JPEG style image_format for WMS 1.0.0
- fix TMS capabilities in demo for TMS with use_grid_names
- fix ctrl+c behaviour in mapproxy-seed
- fix BBOX parsing in autoconf for WMS 1.3.0 services

Other:

- 1.8.0 is expected to work with Python 2.6, but it is no longer officially supported
- MapProxy will now issue warnings about configurations that will change with 2.0.
  doc/mapproxy_2.rst lists some of the planed incompatible changes

1.7.1 2014-07-08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixes:

- fix startup of mapproxy-util when libgdal/geos is missing


1.7.0 2014-07-07
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Features:

- new `mapproxy-util autoconf` tool
- new versions option to limit supported WMS versions
- set different max extents for each SRS with bbox_srs

Improvements:

- display list of MultiMapProxy projects sorted by name
- check included files (base) for changes in reloader and serve-develop
- improve combining of multiple cascaded sources
- respect order of --seed/--cleanup tasks
- catch and log sqlite3.OperationalError when storing tiles
- do not open cascaded responses when image format matches
- mapproxy-seed: retry longer if source fails (100 instead of 10)
- mapproxy-seed: give more details if source request fails
- mapproxy-seed: do not hang nor print traceback if seed ends
  after permanent source errors
- mapproxy-seed: skip seeds/cleanups with empty coverages
- keep order of image_formats in WMS capabilities


Fixes:

- handle errors when loading to many tiles from mbtile/sqlite in
  one batch
- reduce memory when handling large images
- allow remove_all for mbtiles cleanups
- use extent from layer metadata in WMTS capabilities
- handle threshold_res higher than first resolution
- fix exception handling in Mapnik source
- only init libproj when requested

Other:

- 1.7.x is the last release with support for Python 2.5
