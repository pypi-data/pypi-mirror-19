MockSSH was developed to emulate operating systems behind SSH servers
in order to test task automation without having access to the real servers.

There has been interest in using MockSSH to perform end-to-end unit tests
against SSH servers and as such, a threaded version of MockSSH server is
available as of version 1.4 (thanks to Claudio Mignanti).

MockSSH is derived from kippo, an SSH honeypot.
