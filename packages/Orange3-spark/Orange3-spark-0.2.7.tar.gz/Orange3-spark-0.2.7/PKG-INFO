Description: Orange3-Spark
        =============
        
        A set of widgets for Orange data mining suite to work with Apache Spark ML API.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
         - Python >= 3.4
         - Pandas
         - Orange 3
        
        Please follow the instruction to install Orange 3 first.
        
        The main Orange project is hosted at: https://github.com/biolab/orange3
        Download from: http://orange.biolab.si
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
          * A Spark Context.
          * A Hive Table.
          * A Dataframe from an SQL Query.
          * A Dataset Builder, basically a call to VectorAssembler, this is usefull before sending data to Estimators.
          * Transformers from the feature module.
          * Estimators from classification module.
          * Estimators from regression module.
          * Estimators from clustering module.
          * Evaluation from evaluator module.
          * A PySpark script executor + PySpark console.
          * DataFrame transformes for Pandas and Orangle Tables
        
        ... more coming soon!
        
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        First, you need to have Apache Spark installed. Follow the instructions here:
        http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/
        
        Then you can do:
        
            pip install Orange3-spark
        
        or install the add-on from the Orange's Options | Add-ons menu. Note, if
        installing from Add-ons menu, the installation may fail if not all requirements
        are satisfiable.
        
        If you require ODBC connectivity, you need to install `pyodbc`
        (which requires `sql.h` available if built with `pip` â€“
        that's `unixodbc-dev` package on Linux).
        
        If install is ok, you should see a new section in Orange containing a series of widgets from Spark ML API.
