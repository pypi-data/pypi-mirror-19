Installing
----------

First, you need to have Apache Spark installed. Follow the instructions here:
http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/

Then you can do:

    pip install Orange3-spark

or install the add-on from the Orange's Options | Add-ons menu. Note, if
installing from Add-ons menu, the installation may fail if not all requirements
are satisfiable.

If you require ODBC connectivity, you need to install `pyodbc`
(which requires `sql.h` available if built with `pip` â€“
that's `unixodbc-dev` package on Linux).

If install is ok, you should see a new section in Orange containing a series of widgets from Spark ML API.
