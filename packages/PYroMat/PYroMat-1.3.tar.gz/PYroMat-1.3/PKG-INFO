Description: PYroMat provides a Python interface for thermo-physical properties of a 
        wide range of species. PYroMat is distinguished from other excellent 
        thermodynamic resources in a number of ways;
            (1) It takes full advantage of Python's unique features to 
                streamline the user interface (no long hard-to-remember
                function calls)
            (2) There is no attempt to standardize the data at the back-end,
                but there is one standard interface for a wide range of data
                types and sources.
            (3) Data sources are cited with academic rigor.
            (4) The standard package includes tools for users to generate their
                own data and data classes.
        The result is a system that is easy to use from the command line, but
        with the performance needed for advanced modeling.
