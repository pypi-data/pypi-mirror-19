
In the "File" entry type the path of a file generated by SwissManager or choose it by pressing the "Choose..." button and selecting in the file dialog that is opened.
Use the "Method" combo box to select a tie-breaking rule. For the ARPO and ARBO methods one can specify a number of opponents with the worst and best ratings to take out from the average.
It is recomended to sort the output using the first method.
More tie-breaking methods can be obtained. To be able to select more, press the "Add method" button. To simplify the interface use the "Remove method" button.
A default Elo can be specified for unrated players. Select the "Include short headings" check button to include a short description of the methods in the output.
Once the input file, tie-breaking rules and the different options have been selected, press "Ok". A file with the same name and extension "csv" will be generated and opened if possible.
Press "Cancel" to exit.
In the "Options..." dialog box, "Algorithm" tab, a character can be specified for drawn matches in the output of SwissManager. It is also recommend to check the comma separator of the system. It is usually "," or ";" (in Europe). Seeing the csv file successfully depends very much on this choice, although the default setting should work in most cases.
If the external package openpyxl is installed in your Python system you can also choose xlsx in the "Output mode" combo box and display the results in this format.
