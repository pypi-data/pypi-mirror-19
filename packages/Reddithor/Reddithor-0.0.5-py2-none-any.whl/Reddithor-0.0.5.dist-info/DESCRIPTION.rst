Reddithor - a fork of HackerTray - allows you to browse the posts of subreddit of your choice from within the tray of your Linux OS. Reddithor automatically updates every 2 minutes in the background. As mentioned in the readme of HackerTray, this application relies on appindicator, and is not guaranteed to run on every computer.
