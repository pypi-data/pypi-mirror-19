aiocoap -- The Python CoAP library
==================================

The aiocoap package is a Python implementation of CoAP, the Constrained
Application Protocol (`RFC 7252`_, more info at http://coap.technology/).

It uses the Python 3's asynchronous I/O to facilitate concurrent operations
while maintaining a simple to use interface and not depending on anything
outside the standard library.

aiocoap is originally based on txThings_. If you want to use CoAP in your
existing twisted application, or can not migrate to Python 3 yet, that is
probably more useful to you than aiocoap.

.. _`RFC 7252`: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252
.. _txThings: https://github.com/siskin/txThings

Usage
-----

For how to use the aiocoap library, have a look at the guidedtour_, or at
the examples_ and tools_ provided. All the details are in the
`aiocoap module`_ documentation.

All examples can be run directly from a source code copy. If you prefer to
install it, the usual Python mechanisms apply (see installation_).

Features / Standards
--------------------

This library supports the following standards in full or partially:

* RFC7252_ (CoAP): missing are a caching and cross proxy implementation, proper
  multicast (support is incomplete), and DTLS.
* RFC7641_ (Observe): Reordering, re-registration, and active cancellation are
  missing.
* RFC7959_ (Blockwise): Multicast exceptions missing.
* draft-ietf-core-etch-04_: Only registry entries added, but that should be all
  that's neede on the library side.

If something described by one of the standards but not implemented, it is
considered a bug; please file at the `github issue tracker`_. (If it's not on
the list or in the excluded items, file a wishlist item at the same location).

.. _RFC7252: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252
.. _RFC7641: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7641
.. _RFC7959: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7959
.. _draft-ietf-core-etch-04: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-etch-04

Dependencies
------------

The core aiocoap functionality works out of the box with Python_ 3.4; with the
additional asyncio_ module, it works with version 3.3 as well. The
examples_ require Python 3.5 or newer.

When application/link-format typed resources (`RFC 6690`_) are supposed to be
used, the `link_header`_ module is required as well. When the respective code
paths are used without the module, an ``ImportError`` will be raised, or a
5.00 status code will be returned. Python modules that implement servers or
use discovery with aiocoap should declare a dependency on
``'aiocoap[linkheader]'`` instead of ``'aiocoap'``.

.. _`link_header`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/LinkHeader

Development
-----------

aiocoap tries to stay close to PEP8_ recommendations and general best practice,
and should thus be easy to contribute to. Unit tests are implemented in the
``./tests/`` directory and easiest run using ``./setup.py test``; complete test
coverage is aimed for, but not yet complete (and might never be, as the error
handling for pathological network partners is hard to trigger with a library
designed not to misbehave).

Documentation is built using sphinx_ with ``./setup.py build_sphinx``; hacks
used there are described in ``./doc/README.doc``.

Bugs (ranging from "design goal" and "wishlist" to typos) are currently tracked
in the `github issue tracker`_.
