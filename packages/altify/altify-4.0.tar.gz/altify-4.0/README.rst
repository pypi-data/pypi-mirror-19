======

Altify automizes the task of inserting alternative text attributes for
image tags. Altify uses Microsoft Computer Vision API's deep learning
algorithms to caption images in an HTML file and returns a new HTML file
in which alt attributes are filled out with their corresponding
captions.

Notice: Altify will now ignore any image tag whose alt attribute has
content or is just an empty string. (In compliance with standard web
practices)
