"""
Asynchronous MPD client library

Uses the GLib main event loop and python generators for asynchronous communication with a Music Player Daemon server.

A Client connects to an MPD server.
MPD commands are executed by a Worker (or several), which is created by calling a worker function and is executed by the main loop.
A Worker can be started either directly within the Client, or, for more complex applications, within a WorkerGroup.
