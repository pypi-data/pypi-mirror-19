Anipy is a python library that wraps and organize the [Anilist] rest api into modules, classes and functions so it can be used quick, easy, and right out of the box. You can take a look at the api [official docs]. **Anilist is a [Josh Star]'s project**

## Installation

For now the only available versions are alphas. You can Instaled the las by:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/twissell-/anipy.git
$ cd anipy
$ python setup.py # Be sure using Python 3
```

## Usage

I've tried to keep the developer interface as simple as possible.

### Authentication

Before you can access any Anilist resource you have to get authenticated. Once you have [created a client] you must configure ```auth.AuthenticationProvider``` class with your credentials.

Now you can get authenticated with any of the available [grant types]. Aditionaly, Anipy have a ```GrantType.refreshToken``` in case you have saved a refresh token from a previous authentication. *Note that only code and pin authentication gives you a refresh token.*

```python
from anipy import AuthenticationProvider
from anipy import Authentication
from anipy import GrantType

AuthenticationProvider.config('your-client-id', 'your-client-secret', 'your-redirect-uri')

auth = Authentication.fromCredentials()
# or
auth = Authentication.fromCode('code')
# or
auth = Authentication.fromPin('pin')

# Now you can save the refresh token
refresh_token = auth.refreshToken

auth = Authentication.fromRefreshToken(refresh_token)
```

Authentication expires after one hour and will refresh automatically, nevertheless you can do it manually at any time, ie.:

```python
if auth.isExpired:
    auth.refresh()

```

### Resources

Resources are one of the most important parts of the library. They are in charge of go an get the data from the Anilist API. Each domain class have a resource, you can compare them to *Data Access Objects*. All resouces are **Singletons**.

In order to keep things simple you can access the resource from class it serves

```python
# Current logged user
user = User.resource().principal()
# A user for his Id or Display Name
user = User.resource().byId(3225)
user = User.resource().byDisplayName('demo')
```

Some resources are injected in other classes also in order to keep things simple (ie. ```AnimeListResource```). So if you want to get de watching list of a user you can do:

```python
# The long way
resource = AnimeListResource()
watching_list = resource.byUserId(user.id)
# Or the short way
watching_list = user.watching
```

## Roadmap
