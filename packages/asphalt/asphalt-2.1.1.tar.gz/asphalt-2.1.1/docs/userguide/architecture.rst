Application architecture
========================

Asphalt applications are built by assembling a hierarchy of *components*. Each component typically
provides some specific functionality for the application, like a network server or client, a
database connection or a myriad of other things. A component's lifecycle is usually very short:
it's instantiated and its :meth:`~asphalt.core.component.Component.start` method is run and the
component is then discarded. A common exception to this are command line tools, where the root
component's ``start()`` call typically lasts for the entire run time of the tool.

Components work together through a shared :class:`~asphalt.core.context.Context`. Every application
has at least a top level context which is passed to the root component's
:meth:`~asphalt.core.component.Component.start` method. A context is essentially a container for
*resources* and a namespace for arbitrary data attributes. Resources can be objects of any type
like data or services.

Contexts can have subcontexts. How and if subcontexts are used depends on the components using
them. For example, a component serving network requests may want to create a subcontext for each
request it handles to store request specific information and other state. While the subcontext will
have its own independent state, it also has full access the resources of its parent context.

An Asphalt application is normally started by calling :func:`~asphalt.core.runner.run_application`
with the root component as the argument. This function takes care of logging and and starting the
root component in the event loop. The application will then run until Ctrl+C is pressed, the
process is terminated from outside or the application code stops the event loop.

The runner is further extended by the ``asphalt`` command line tool which reads the application
configuration from a YAML formatted configuration file, instantiates the root component and calls
:func:`~asphalt.core.runner.run_application`. The settings from the configuration file are merged
with hard coded defaults so the config file only needs to override settings where necessary.

Components
----------

Components are the basic building blocks of an Asphalt application. They have a narrowly defined
set of responsibilities:

#. Take in configuration through the constructor
#. Validate the configuration
#. Publish resources (in :meth:`~asphalt.core.component.Component.start`)
#. Close/shut down/cleanup resources when the context is finished (by adding a callback on the
   ``finished`` signal of the context, or by using :func:`~asphalt.core.context.context_finisher`)

In the :meth:`~asphalt.core.component.Component.start` method, the component receives a
:class:`~asphalt.core.context.Context` as its only argument. The component can use the context to
publish resources for other components and the application business logic to use. It can also
request resources provided by other components to provide some complex service that builds on those
resources.

The :meth:`~asphalt.core.component.Component.start` method of a component is only called once,
during application startup. When all components have been started, they are disposed of.
If any of the components raises an exception, the application startup process fails and the context
is finished.

In order to speed up the startup process and to prevent any deadlocks, components should try to
publish any resources as soon as possible before requesting any. If two or more components end up
waiting on each others' resources, the application will fail to start due to timeout errors.
Also, if a component needs to perform lengthy operations like connection validation on network
clients, it should publish all its resources first to avoid said timeouts.

.. hint::
    It is a good idea to use `type hints`_ with typeguard_ checks
    (``assert check_argument_types()``) in the component's ``__init__`` method to ensure that the
    received configuration values are of the expected type, but this is of course not required.

Container components
--------------------

A *container component* is component that can contain other Asphalt components.
The root component of virtually any nontrivial Asphalt application is a container component.
Container components can of course contain other container components and so on.

When the container component starts its child components, each
:meth:`~asphalt.core.component.Component.start` call is launched in its own task. Therefore all the
child components start concurrently and cannot rely on the start order. This is by design.
The only way components should be relying on each other is by the publishing and requesting of
resources in their shared context.

Context hierarchies
-------------------

As mentioned previously, every application has at least one context. Component code and application
business logic can create new contexts at any time, and a new context can be linked to a parent
context to take advantage of its resources. Such *subcontexts* have access to all the resources of
the parent context, but parent contexts cannot access resources from their subcontexts. Sometimes
it may also be beneficial to create completely isolated contexts to ensure consistent behavior
when some reusable code is plugged in an application.

A common use case for creating subcontexts is when a network server handles an incoming request.
Such servers typically want to create a separate subcontext for each request, usually using
specialized subclass of :class:`~asphalt.core.context.Context`.

Resources
---------

The resource system in Asphalt exists for two principal reasons:

* To avoid having to duplicate configuration
* To enable sharing of pooled resources, like database connection pools

Here are a few examples of services that will likely benefit from resource sharing:

* Database connections
* Remote service handles
* Serializers
* Template renderers
* SSL contexts

When you publish a resource, you should make sure that the resource is discoverable using any
abstract interface or base class that it implements. This is so that consumers of the service don't
have to care if you switch the implementation of another. For example, consider a mailer service,
provided by asphalt-mailer_. The library has an abstract base class for all mailers,
``asphalt.mailer.api.Mailer``. To facilitate this loose coupling of services, it publishes all
mailers as Mailers.

Lazy resources
--------------

Resources can also be published *lazily*. That means they're created *on demand*, that is, either
when their context attribute is accessed or when the resource is being requested for the first
time. Unlike with normal resources, the resource values are not inherited by subcontexts, but every
time the resource is requested in a new context, a new value is created specifically for that
context.

There are at least a couple plausible reasons for publishing resources this way:

* The resource needs access to the resources or data specific to the local context
  (example: template renderers)
* The life cycle of the resource needs to be tied to the life cycle of the context
  (example: database transactions)

Lazy resources are published using :meth:`~asphalt.core.context.Context.publish_lazy_resource`.
Instead of passing a static value to it, you give it a callable that takes the local context
object (whatever that may be) as the argument and returns the created resource object. The creator
callable will only be called at most once per context.

The creator callable can be a coroutine function or return an awaitable, in which case the
coroutine or other awaitable is resolved before returning the resource object to the caller. This
approach has the unfortunate limitation that the awaitable cannot be automatically resolved on
attribute access so something like ``await ctx.resourcename`` is required when such resources are
accessed through their context attributes.
