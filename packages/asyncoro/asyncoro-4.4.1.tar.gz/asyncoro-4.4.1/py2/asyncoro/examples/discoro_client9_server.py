# Run 'discoronode.py' program to start processes to execute computations sent
# by this client, along with this program.

# This example illustrates in-memory processing with 'proc_available' to read
# date in to memory by each (remote) server process. Remote coroutines
# ('compute' in this case) then process data in memory. This example works with
# POSIX (Linux, OS X etc.) and Windows. Note that, as data is read in to each
# server process, a node may have multiple copies of data in memory of each
# process on that node, so this approach is not practical / efficient when data
# is large. See 'discoro_client9_node.py' which uses 'node_available' and
# 'node_setup' to read data in to memory at node (and thus only one copy is in
# memory).
