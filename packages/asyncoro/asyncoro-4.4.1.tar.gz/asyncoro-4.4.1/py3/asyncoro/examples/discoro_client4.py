# This example shows how to use message passing, transferring files.
# The input files are assumed to be in current working directory as
# 'input0.dat', 'input1.dat', ..., 'input9.dat' (10 input files).
# 'submit_jobs_proc' creates jobs as and when a discoro process is found,
# or a process finishes a job. Each job is processed by a remote coroutine
# (rcoro) and a corresponding local coroutine (with 'client_proc')
# interacts with that rcoro to send the input data to where rcoro is,
# an instance of class C to give the information needed to process the
# file. Client then waits for rcoro to finish processing job, send the resulting
# output file in the form 'outputX.dat' and result (in this case, it is
# the return value of 'send_file').

# Note that the objective is to illustrate features, so implementation
# is not ideal. Error checking is skipped at a few places for brevity.
