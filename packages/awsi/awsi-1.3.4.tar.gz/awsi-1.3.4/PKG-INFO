Description: AWS Instance Information
        ========================
        
        
        Summary
        -------
        awsi script can help search for a server in aws and connect to it.
        
        It relies on you having boto installed and aws profiles set up containing your key and secret for each aws account.
        it has its own config file which list the profiles to use and the regions to search.
        
        It can generate a cache of all servers in the configured regions by calling <code>awsi refresh</code>
        
        It can then connect to an instance using the instanceId, public ip address or name tag
        If more than one server is found (maybe they have the same name) it will show you all of them and require you to use a different
        piece of information. ID is unique so this is recommended.
