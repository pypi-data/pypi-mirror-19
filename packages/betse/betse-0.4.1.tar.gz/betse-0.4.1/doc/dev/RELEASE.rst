Releasing
=========

Stable releases of BETSE are produced with a rigorous procedure reminiscent to
that of most open-source software: *namely,*

#. A stable commit is **tagged** with an annotated Git tag.
#. That commit is **packaged** into a compressed source tarball.
#. That tarball is **uploaded** to third-party services for public consumption.

While technically optional, this procedure reduces the likelihood of
installation and usage woes by downstream consumers (\ *e.g.,* end users,
package maintainers) and is thus effectively mandatory.

.. # ------------------( TABLE OF CONTENTS                   )------------------
.. # Blank line. By default, Docutils appears to only separate the subsequent
.. # table of contents heading from the prior paragraph by less than a single
.. # blank line, hampering this table's readability and aesthetic comeliness.

.. # Table of contents, excluding the above document heading. While the
.. # official reStructuredText documentation suggests that a language-specific
.. # heading will automatically prepend this table, this does *NOT* appear to
.. # be the case. Instead, this heading must be explicitly declared.

Procedure
============

BETSE is releasable to all supported platforms as follows:

#. **Install** wheel_, a third-party pure-Python package permitting this release
   to be packaged into a cross-platform pre-compiled binary distribution
   supported by both PyPI_ and `pip`. This mandatory dependency augments
   setuptools with the ``bdist_wheel`` subcommand invoked below.

   .. code:: bash

      $ sudo pip3 install wheel

#. (\ *Optional*\ ) **Install** twine_, a third-party pure-Python package
   simplifying remote communication with both `PyPI itself <PyPI_>`__ and
   `Test PyPI`_. While optional, securely registering and uploading PyPI
   distributions *without* twine_ is typically non-trivial, banal, and tedious.
   :sup:`Your mileage may vary.`
#. (\ *Optional*\ ) **List all existing tags.** For reference, listing all
   previously created tags *before* creating new tags is often advisable.

   .. code:: bash

      $ git tag

#. **Create an announcement commit.** This commit should have a message whose:

   * First line is of the format ``"BETSE {version} ({codename}) released."``,
     where:

     * ``{version}`` is the current value of the ``betse.metadata.__version__``
       global.
     * ``{codename}`` is the current value of the ``betse.metadata.CODENAME``
       global.

   * Remaining lines are a changelog synopsizing the most significant changes
     implemented by this release â€“ ideally in the enumerated format given below.

   For example::

       BETSE 0.4.0 (Glad Galvani) released.

       Major changes include:

       * Tissue profiles generalized.
       * Animation video encoding supported.
       * Simulation stability and efficiency improved.

#. **Tag this commit.** An annotated tag\ [#tags]_ should be created whose:

   * Name is ``v{version}``, where:

     * ``v`` is an arbitrary prefix preserving historical consistency with
       previous tag names in this repository.
     * ``{version}`` is the current value of the ``betse.metadata.__version__``
       global.

   * Message is the same commit message created above.

   .. code:: bash

      $ git tag -a v{version}

#. **Push this tagged commit.** After doing so, Gitlab will automatically
   publish source tarballs in various formats (e.g., `.zip`, `.tar.bz2`)
   containing the contents of this repository at this tagged commit in this
   project's `source tarball archive <tarballs_>`__. No further work is required
   to distribute source tarballs via Gitlab.

   .. code:: bash

      $ git push && git push --tags

#. (\ *Optional*\ ) **Test the installation of this release.** If installation
   of this release differs from that of prior releases, testing *before*
   publishing this release to PyPI_ and elsewhere is advisable.

   #. **Package both a source tarball and binary wheel.**

      .. code:: bash
   
         $ python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

   #. **Test this release on** `Test PyPI`_ by following `these instructions
      <Test PyPI instructions_>`__, omitted here to avoid desynchronization with
      upstream's moving target.

#. **Upload this tarball to PyPI_.**
#. **Bump the application version.** In preparation for subsequent development
   of the next version of this application:

   #. The ``betse.metadata.__version__`` global should be incremented according
      to the `best practices <Versioning_>`__ provided below.
   #. The ``betse.metadata.CODENAME`` global should be incremented according
      to the `best practices <Code Naming_>`__ provided below.

#. **Create another announcement commit.** This commit should have a message
   whose first line is of the format ``"BETSE {version} ({codename})
   started."``, where:

     * ``{version}`` is the new value of the ``betse.metadata.__version__``
       global.
     * ``{codename}`` is the new value of the ``betse.metadata.CODENAME``
       global.

   Since no changelog for this release yet exists, a single-line message
   suffices for this commit..

   For example::

       BETSE 0.4.1 (Gladder Galvani) started.

.. [#tags]
   Do *not* create a lightweight tag, which omits critical metadata (e.g.,
   author identity, descriptive message). *Always* create an annotated tag
   containing this metadata by explicitly passing the ``-a`` option to the
   ``git tag`` subcommand.

Versioning
============

This application should be **versioned** (i.e., assigned a new version)
according to the `Semantic Versioning`_ schema. Each version *must* consist of
three ``.``-delimited integers ``{major}.{minor}.{patch}``, where:

- ``{major}`` is the **major version,** incremented only when either:
  - **Breaking backward compatibility with existing simulation configurations.**
    The public API of this application is its configuration file format rather
    than the public subset of its codebase (e.g., public submodules or classes).
    No codebase change can be considered to break backward compatibility unless
    also changing the simulation configuration file format in a manner rendering
    existing files in the prior format unusable. Note that doing so is
    unequivocally bad and hence *much* discouraged.
  - **Implementing headline-worthy functionality** (e.g., a GUI). Technically,
    this condition breaks the `Semantic Versioning`_ schema, which stipulates
    that *only* changes breaking backward compatibility warrant major bumps.
    But this is the real world. In the real world, significant improvements
    are rewarded with significant version changes.
  In either case, the minor and patch versions both reset to 0.
- ``{minor}`` is the **minor version,** incremented only when implementing
  customary functionality in a manner preserving backward compatibility. In this
  case, only the patch version resets to 0.
- ``{patch}`` is the **patch version,** incremented only when correcting
  outstanding issues in a manner preserving backward compatibility.

When in doubt, bump only the minor version and reset only the patch version.

Code Naming
============

This application should be **code named** (i.e., assigned a new human-readable
code name) according to the following crude distortion of the `Ubuntu code name
schema`_. Each code name *must* consist of two capitalized English words
``{adjective} {bioelectrician}``, where:

- ``{adjective}`` is an arbitrary adjective whose first letter is the same as
  that of the first character of the subsequent ``{bioelectrician}``.
- ``{bioelectrician}`` is the last name of an arbitrary academic associated with
  the long-standing field of bioelectricity.

Unlike the `Ubuntu code name schema`_, the first letter of the code name for
each version need *not* succeed the first letter of the code name for the prior
version. For our insignificant purposes, preserving alphabetization across code
names is a fruitless and hence worthless goal.
