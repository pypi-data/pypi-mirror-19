bguo
====
File-based contact management

Concept
-------
Each contact corresponds to a single file inside of the bguo directory.
Contact information should be edited in this directory and then exported
to various output formats for use by other programs. They can also be
roughly imported to this directory, but you will have to proofread the
results; the importers are intended for one-time imports, not for
regular synchronization with other programs.

For our purposes, a contact is a thing with a single name, a single
email address, &c. People, mailing lists, and organizations can all be
contacts. bguo has no special features for grouping contacts.

Usage
-------
Install ::

    pip3 install bguo

Help ::

    bguo -h

Examples ::

    wget http://src.thomaslevine.com/bguo/tarball/bguo.tar.gz
    tar xzf bguo.tar.gz
    cd bguo/examples
    make

Supported formats
-----------------
bguo supports only the formats that I (`Tom <https://thomaslevine.com>`_) have used.

* MH ``~/.aliases`` file
* Mutt ``alias_file``
* Newsbeuter ``~/.newsbeuter/urls``
* Plain postal addresses
* VoIP.ms phonebook export 
* Seltzer CRM member listing (``/?q=members``)

For most of these formats, only the import or the export is supported,
not both. This is summarized in the table below.

============= ====== ======
Format        Import Export
============= ====== ======
MH            Yes    Yes
Mutt          Yes    Yes
Seltzer       Yes    No
VoIP.ms       Yes    No
Newsbeuter    No     Yes
Post          No     Yes
============= ====== ======

For imports, command-line program expects that you are converting from
only one format to bguo. There was a case where I wanted to merge two
formats for existing contacts, one for email addresses (MH) and the
other for phone numbers (VoIP.MS). To do this, write a custom merging
program with the functions in ``bguo.parse``; ``examples/merge.py`` is
an example.
