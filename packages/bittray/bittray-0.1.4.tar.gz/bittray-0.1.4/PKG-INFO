           Bittray running inside tint2.
        
        Bittray is an application to display the current bitcoin price in your
        systray. If you enable electrum support it provides a handy launch menu
        for your wallets.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        It's probably the best to install wx and pillow through your operating
        system, on Debian use::
        
            apt-get install python-wxgtk3.0 python-pil
        
        Python3 is not supported at this moment, wx is not packaged for it in Debian,
        and some of the code would need porting as well. Nothing big, but I can't do it
        yet.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install bittray and some dependencies run::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        After this you can use the `bittray` command, assuming the script is
        somewhere on your `PATH`.
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        A default configuration file will be create in `~/.config/bittray/bittray.cfg`,
        please see there for available settings.
        
        You should not delete settings from the configuration file, the application
        doesn't have internal default values. On upgrades new settings should be added
        automatically, if not please report a bug.
        
        If you update the configuration while `bittray` is running you can make it
        reload the configuration with `pkill -SIGUSR1 bittray`.
        
        Planned features
        ================
        
        - Notifications for price changes, will require a price history
        - Possibly support more wallets
        - Dynamic price color, probably hooked into the notification logic
