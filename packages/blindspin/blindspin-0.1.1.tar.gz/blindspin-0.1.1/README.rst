BlindSpin: Braille Spinner for Python
=====================================

Sometimes you would just like to show the user some progress,
but a progress bar is not suitable because you donâ€™t know how much longer it would take.
In these cases you might want to display a simple spinner using the `spinner()` function.

Example usage::

    with blindspin.spinner():
        do_something()
        do_something_else()


It looks like this:
