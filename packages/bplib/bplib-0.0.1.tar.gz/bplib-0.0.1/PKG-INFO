Description: The bplib is a library implementing support for computations on groups supporting 
              bilinear pairings, as used in modern cryptography. 
        
              It provides python bindings to Diego Aranha's OpenPairing libraries, that use OpenSSL math 
              and crypto primitives. The bplib library is an extension of petlib that provides easy to use 
              support for maths and ciphers used un modern Privacy Enhancing Technologies."
