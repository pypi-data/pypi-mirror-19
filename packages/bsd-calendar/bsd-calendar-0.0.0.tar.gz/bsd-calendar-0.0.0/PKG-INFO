Description: The calendar utility reads events from plain text files and outputs today's
        events. The files look something like this::
        
            #include <holiday>
            #include <birthday>
        
            06/15\tJune 15
            Thu\tEvery Thursday.
            15\t15th of every month.
        
            05/Sun+2\tsecond Sunday in May (Muttertag)
            04/Sun-1\tlast Sunday in April
        
            Easter-2\tGood Friday (2 days before Easter)
            Paskha\tOrthodox Easter
        
        This implementation adds some new features while dropping others, most notably,
        the date formats are not completely compatible::
        
            # added formats
            1999/06/15\tJune 15 1999
            1999/06/15*\tJune 15 (usefull for birthdays)
            1999/05/Sun+2\tsecond Sunday in May 1999
            1999/06/15+2\tJune 15 1999 and every second week since then
        
            # removed formats (mostly alternative formats)
            Jun. 15\t06/15
