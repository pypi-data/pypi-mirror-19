python-btrfs
============

Btrfs is a copy on write (COW) filesystem for Linux aimed at implementing
advanced features while focusing on fault tolerance, repair and easy
administration.

The python module acts as a wrapper around the low level kernel calls and btrfs
data structures, presenting them as python objects with interesting attributes
and references to other objects.

The module is in very early development, support for filesystem structures will
be added one after another.
