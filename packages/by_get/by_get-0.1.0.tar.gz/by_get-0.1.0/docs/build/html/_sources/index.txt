by_get
======

by_get downloads all image files of a given text file of URLs and places them in
the working directory.

Good URLs and the resulting image file names are written to STDOUT. Bad
URLs and their error codes are written to STDERR. Images are saved to the
working directory and named with the SHA256 hash of the (clean) source URL
to avoid overwriting homonymous files from other URLs.

Redirects are handled transparently and non-image responses (e.g. HTML from
domain parking servers) are filtered out. Existing connections are re-used
where possible to reduce the overhead of connection negotiation when
repeatedly requesting images from the same server.
