Description: ======
        by_get
        ======
        
        by_get downloads all image files of a given text file of URLs and places them in
        the working directory.
        
        Good URLs and the resulting image file names are written to STDOUT. Bad
        URLs and their error codes are written to STDERR. Images are saved to the
        working directory and named with the SHA256 hash of the (clean) source URL
        to avoid overwriting homonymous files from other URLs.
        
        Redirects are handled transparently and non-image responses (e.g. HTML from
        domain parking servers) are filtered out. Existing connections are re-used
        where possible to reduce the overhead of connection negotiation when
        repeatedly requesting images from the same server.
        
        Quick Start
        ===========
        
        Installing by_get
        -----------------
        
        Download and install the current by_get package on your system by executing
        the following command as administrator::
        
        	pip3 install by_get
        
        Previous versions will be uninstalled automatically. The installation can be
        tested with ::
        
        	by_get -h
        
        If everything went fine you should see the program's help text.
        
        First Steps
        -----------
        
        A typical download is started by issuing the following command::
        
        	by_get my_urls.txt
        
        where 
        
        Uninstalling by_get
        -------------------
        
        To get rid of by_get simply execute the following command as administrator::
        
        	pip3 uninstall by_get
        
        The Python utility ``pip3`` will list all currently installed
        available versions for selective removal. Proceed similarly with any required
        packages (e.g. ``pytest``) if you don't need them anymore.
