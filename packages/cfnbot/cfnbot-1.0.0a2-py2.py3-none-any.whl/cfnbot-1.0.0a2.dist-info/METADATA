Description: cfnbot
        ======
        
        Make managing CloudFormation stacks a little friendlier.
        
        **Still very much a work in progress**
        
        Install
        ~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install cfnbot
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            # First, write a specfile. See `example_specfile.yml` for more info.
            $ cfnbot deploy [--debug] /path/to/specfile.yml [--stackset <name>]
            $ cfnbot delete [--debug] /path/to/specfile.yml [--stackset <name>]
        
        Specfile Formats
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Single Stack
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        One top key only, which can't be "Default" or "Stacks". Must contain a
        TemplatePath.
        
        ::
        
            ---
            SomeAppBucket:
                TemplatePath: 'bucket.yml'
                Parameters: [...]
        
        Multiple Stacks
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        One top key only, "Stacks", and its value must be a list. For example:
        
        ::
        
            ---
            Stacks:
                - SomeAppBucketRole:
                    TemplatePath: cfn/iam_role.yml
                    Parameters: [...]
                - SomeAppBucket:
                    TemplatePath: cfn/s3bucket_with_roles.yml
                    StackName: SomeAppBucket
                    Parameters: [...]
        
        Stack Sets
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ALL THE THINGS. Need a Default in there somewhere, and it needs a Stacks
        list.
        
        ::
        
            ---
            Dev:
              StackNamePrefix: Dev
              CredentialProfile: default
              Stacks:
                - SomeAppBucketLambdaRole
                    TemplatePath: cfn/iam_role_dev.yml
            Default:
                Stacks:
                    - SomeAppBucketRole:
                        TemplatePath: cfn/iam_role.yml
                        Parameters: [...]
                    - SomeAppBucket:
                        TemplatePath: cfn/s3bucket_with_roles.yml
                        StackName: SomeAppBucket
                        Parameters: [...]
