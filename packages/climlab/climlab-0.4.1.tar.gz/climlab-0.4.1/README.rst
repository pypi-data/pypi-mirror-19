-  Source code: http://github.com/brian-rose/climlab


Installation
----------------
``python setup.py install``

    or, if you are developing new code

``python setup.py develop``

This will trigger the build process for the Fortran components.

Dependencies
-----------------
Required
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Python 2.7
- numpy
- scipy

Recommended for full functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- a Fortran compiler (tested with both gcc/gfortran and ifort)
- netCDF4 Python package (for data i/o)
- numba Python package (used for acceleration of some components)

Anaconda Python is highly recommended and will provide everything you need.

About climlab
--------------
``climlab`` is a flexible engine for process-oriented climate modeling.
It is based on a very general concept of a model as a collection of individual,
interacting processes. ``climlab`` defines a base class called ``Process``, which
can contain an arbitrarily complex tree of sub-processes (each also some
sub-class of ``Process``). Every climate process (radiative, dynamical,
physical, turbulent, convective, chemical, etc.) can be simulated as a stand-alone
process model given appropriate input, or as a sub-process of a more complex model.
New classes of model can easily be defined and run interactively by putting together an
appropriate collection of sub-processes.

Currently, ``climlab`` has out-of-the-box support and documented examples for

- 1D radiative and radiative-convective single column models, with various radiation schemes:
    - Grey Gas
    - Simplified band-averaged models (4 bands each in longwave and shortwave)
    - One GCM-level radiation module (CAM3)
- 1D diffusive energy balance models
- Seasonal and steady-state models
- Arbitrary combinations of the above, for example:
    - 2D latitude-pressure models with radiation, horizontal diffusion, and fixed relative humidity
- orbital / insolation calculations
- boundary layer sensible and latent heat fluxes


Documentation
------------------
Full user manual available here_.

Example usage
------------------
The directory ``climlab/courseware/`` contains a collection of Jupyter / IPython
notebooks (*.ipynb) used for teaching some basics of climate science,
and documenting use of the ``climlab`` package.
These are self-describing, and should all run out-of-the-box once the package is installed, e.g:

``jupyter notebook Insolation.ipynb``


History
----------------------
The first versions of the code and notebooks were originally developed in winter / spring 2014
in support of an undergraduate course at the University at Albany.
See the original course webpage at
http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ENV480_Spring2014/

The package and its API was completely redesigned around a truly object-oriented
modeling framework in January 2015.

It was used extensively for a graduate-level climate modeling course in Spring 2015:
http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2015/
Many more examples are found in the online lecture notes for that course:
http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/brian-rose/ClimateModeling_courseware/blob/master/index.ipynb

Version 0.3 was released in February 2016. It includes many internal changes and
some backwards-incompatible changes (hopefully simplifications) to the public API.
It also includes the CAM3 radiation module.

Version 0.4 was released in October 2016. It includes comprehensive documentation,
an automated test suite, support for latitude-longitude grids, and numerous small enhancements and bug fixes.

The documentation_ was first created by Moritz Kreuzer (Potsdam Institut for Climate Impact Research) as part of a thesis project in Spring 2016.
