# cmsplugin-articles-ai

Articles manager for Django CMS

This CMS app provides a way to manage articles. You need to implement the frontend by yourself.

    installing them by running `pip install cmsplugin-articles-ai[utils]`
2. Add `'cmsplugin_articles_ai'` to `INSTALLED_APPS`
3. Implement frontend
    - This package includes only reference templates in (`templates/cmsplugin-articles-ai/`).
    - This package does not include any styling.
