        ==================================
        
        This package defines some helper viewlets to easily insert code on the layout of a Plone site.
        
        One use case is the insertion of ad code from sites like DoubleClick.
        
        The name comes from the `blue-line process`_, a document reproduction produced by using the diazo chemical process.
        You already know the rest of the story.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this package in a buildout-based installation:
        
        #. Edit your buildout.cfg and add add the following to it::

            ...
            eggs =
