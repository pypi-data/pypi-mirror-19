        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        `collective.logbook` works with Plone 4 and Plone 5.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        These instructions assume that you already have a Plone buildout that's built
        and ready to run.
        
        Edit your buildout.cfg file and look for the eggs key in the instance section.
        Add collective.logbook to that list. Your list will look something like this::
        
            eggs =
                ...
                collective.logbook
        
        Run buildout.
        
        Activate the add-on via Site Setup > Add ons.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        With `collective.logbook` enabled, it is simple to see all errors occured in your Plone site::
        
            >>> portal = self.getPortal()
            >>> browser = self.getBrowser()
            >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic admin:secret')
        
        Remember some URLs::
        
            >>> portal_url = portal.absolute_url()
            >>> logbook_controlpanel_url = portal_url + "/@@logbook-controlpanel"
            >>> logbook_test_error_url = portal_url + "/@@error-test"
            >>> logbook_url = portal_url + "/@@logbook"
        
        Browse to the `@@logbook` view::
        
            >>> browser.open(logbook_url)
            >>> 'Congratulations, there are 0 Errors in your Plone Site!' in browser.contents
            True
        
        Now lets create an error with the `@@error-test` view::
        
            >>> browser.open(logbook_test_error_url)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            HTTPError: HTTP Error 500: Internal Server Error
        
            >>> browser.open(logbook_url)
            >>> "There are 1 saved (unique) Tracebacks and 0 referenced Tracebacks" in browser.contents
            True
        
        The same error will be referenced::
        
            >>> browser.open(logbook_test_error_url)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            HTTPError: HTTP Error 500: Internal Server Error
        
            >>> browser.open(logbook_url)
            >>> "There are 1 saved (unique) Tracebacks and 1 referenced Tracebacks" in browser.contents
            True
        
        There is also a `@@random-error-test` view, which randomly selects different tracebacks for testing.
        
        Logbook logging can be deactivated on purpose in the `@@logbook-controlpanel` view::
        
            >>> browser.open(logbook_controlpanel_url)
            >>> browser.getControl(name="form.widgets.logbook_enabled:list").value = []
            >>> browser.getControl(name="form.buttons.save").click()
        
        Errors should not be logged anymore::
        
            >>> browser.open(logbook_test_error_url)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            HTTPError: HTTP Error 500: Internal Server Error
        
            >>> browser.open(logbook_url)
            >>> "There are 1 saved (unique) Tracebacks and 1 referenced Tracebacks" in browser.contents
            True
        
        Finally, we remove all errors::
        
            >>> browser.open(logbook_url)
            >>> browser.getControl(name="form.button.deleteall").click()
            >>> 'Congratulations, there are 0 Errors in your Plone Site!' in browser.contents
            True
        
        
        Settings
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        See Site Setup for logbook settings at http://your-plone-site/@@logbook-controlpanel
        
        
        Inspecting errors
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        After install, go to http://your-plone-site/@@logbook
        
        The errors are logged there. You can tune some parameters.
        
        
        Testing
        ~~~~~~~
        
        ``collective.logbook`` provides a view ``error-test`` which Site managers can access to
        generate a test traceback.
        
        First visit ``@@error-test`` and make sure the error appears in ``@@logbook`` view.
        
        .. note ::
        
            You might need to turn on both Logbook enabled and Large site in Logbook Site Setup.
            This may be a bug regarding new Plone versions and production mode.
        
        
        Web hooks
        ---------
        
        ``collective.logbook`` provides ability to HTTP POST
        error message to any web service when an error happens in Plone.
        This behavior is called a web hook.
        
        Use cases
        
        * `Showing Plone errors real-time in Skype chat <https://github.com/opensourcehacker/sevabot>`_
        
        * `Routing errors to different websites and services via Zapier <https://zapier.com/>`_
        
        In Site Setup > Logbook you can enter URLs where HTTP POST will be asynchronously
        performed on a traceback. HTTP POST payload is an message from Logbook,
        containing a link for further information.
        
        .. note ::
        
            Currently repeated errros (same traceback signature) are not POST'ed again.
            You will receive message only once unless until you clear logbook contents in
            @@logbook management view.
        
        
        Motivation
        ----------
        
        For anonymous users Plone generates an Error Page which contains an error
        number. But what to do with this error number?
        
        You have to log into your plone site, go to the ZMI, check the error_log
        object and probably construct the url by hand to get the proper error with
        this error number, like::
        
            http://your-plone-site/error_log/showEntry?id=1237283091.10.529903983894
        
        If you are lucky, you will find the error. If not, and the number of occured
        errors exceeded the number of exceptions to keep, or maybe a cronjob restarted
        your zope instance, then....
        
        Hmm, not really smooth this behaviour.
        
        Wouldn't it be better to have a nice frontend where you can paste the error
        number to a field and search for it? Keep all log persistent, also when zope
        restarts? Keep only unique errors and not thousand times the same Error? Get
        an email when a new, unique error occured, so you know already what's going on
        before your customer mails this error number to you?
        
        If you think that this would be cool, collective.logbook is what you want:)
        
        
        SiteErrorLog Patch
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        `collective.logbook` patches the raising method of
        `Products.SiteErrorLog.SiteErrorLog`::
        
            from Products.SiteErrorLog.SiteErrorLog import SiteErrorLog
        
            _raising = SiteErrorLog.raising
        
            def raising(self, info):
                enty_url = _raising(self, info)
                notify(ErrorRaisedEvent(self, enty_url))
                return enty_url
        
        The patch fires an `ErrorRaisedEvent` event before it returns the enty_url. The
        entry url is the link to the standard SiteErrorLog like::
        
            http://your-plone-site/error_log/showEntry?id=1237283091.10.529903983894
        
        The patch gets _only_ then installed, when you install collective.logbook over
        the portal_quickinstaller tool and removes the patch, when you uninstall it.
        
        You can also deactivate the patch over the logbook configlet of the plone
        control panel.
        
        
        Log Storage
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The default storage is an annotation storage on the plone site root::
        
            <!-- default storage adapter -->
            <adapter
                for="*"
                factory=".storage.LogBookStorage"
              />
        
        The default storage adapter creates 2 PersistentDict objects in your portal.
        One 'main' storage and one 'index' storage, which keeps track of referenced
        errors.
        
        
        The storage will be fetched via an adapter lookup. So the more specific
        adapter will win. Maybe an SQL storage with SQLAlchemy would be nice here:)
        
        
        Notify Event
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        When a new unique error occurs, an INotifyTraceback event gets fired. An
        email event handler is already registered with collective.logbook::
        
            <subscriber
                for=".interfaces.INotifyTraceback"
                handler=".events.mailHandler"
              />
        
        This handler will email new tracebacks to the list of email adresses
        specified in the logbook configlet of the plone control panel.
        
        
        Configuration
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        collective.logbook now uses Plone 5's registry to store its configuration.
        It has 3 configuration keys:
        
          - logbook.logbook_log_mails
          - logbook.logbook_large_site
          - logbook.logbook_webhook_urls
        
        These properties take the values you enter in logbook configlet in the plone
        control panel.
        
        The first one is used to email new tracebacks to these email addresses.
        
        The second one changes some behaviour for large sites.
        
        The third one does an HTTP POST to some URLs when an error occurs.
