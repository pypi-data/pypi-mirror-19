        Features
        --------
        
        - Advanced implementation of unite gallery into Plone using collective.plonetruegallery
        Some of the options are still missing, feel free to fork and merge.
        
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        http://unitegallery.net/
        
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        Currently We've added some of the unitegallery options, but maybe all the options shoud be added even if the formuar becomes very long.
        The options can be found on unitegallery.net, for each theme under Including and Options menu.
        
        There shoud be a way to make better formulars with grouped fields because when there are so many fields, it becomes userunfriendly.
        
        Plone 4 compatibility (as in Plone 5, requirejs is used to add unitegallery javascript and not in Plone 4)
