        Diff docker-compose files. When deploying using docker-compose, these
        files could be used to generate Release Notes. Especially interesting is
        to diff two docker-compose Releases by each other, then customers know
        the changed components and testers know which part to especially test.
        
        Usage

        After that use it like
        
        ``compose_diff --versions old.yml new.yml`` this will print the
        differences in the used versions/tags between the two compose files.
        
        ``compose_diff --instances old.yml new.yml`` this will print the amount
        of instances of this image between the two compose files.
