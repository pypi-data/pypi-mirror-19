Description: Concur API SDK
        ===============
        The Concur API SDK is a Python client library designed to support Concur's Developer APIs.
        You can read more about the Official API by accessing its `official documentation <http://developer.concur.com>`_.
        
        System Requirements
        --------------------
        
        Concur API SDK depends on the following Python libraries:
        
        * requests
        
        Installation
        ------------
        Install using `pip`:
        
        ::
        
          pip install concurapi.
        
        
        Configuration
        --------------
        You'll need to register at `Concur's Administration site <https://www.concursolutions.com/>`_.
        Before you create a partner application, make sure your user account has web service administrator access.
        You can create a partner application by following these steps.
        
        * Log on to Concur's Administration using your username and password
        
        * Follow the links *Administration* -> *Company* -> *Web Services*
        
        * Click on the link to register a partner application in the left navigation bar.
        
        * In the next screen click on the **New** button to create a new application
        
        * In the modal dialog, you can choose the permissions for the actions you need to automate.
        
        Also, please note the system generated **Key** and **Secret**. These values are used by the sdk to make a call
        to Concur's API.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        Before you use the sdk, you'll need to register a partner application and retrieve a Key/Secret. Please see Configuration_.
        You'll also need to install the client sdk using ``pip``. Please see `System Requirements`_ and Installation_.
