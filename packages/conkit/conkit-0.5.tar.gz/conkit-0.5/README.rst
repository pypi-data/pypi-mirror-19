Contact Prediction ToolKit

**A Python Interface to contact predictions**

This project is a result of the continuous struggle using residue-residue contact prediction pipelines, visualisation tools and related software. The aim was to reduce this complexity and provide one unified interface as a basic platform. The resulting platform is the Contact Prediction ToolKit, or ConKit in short.
