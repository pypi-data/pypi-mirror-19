Description: *CorefGraph is an independent python module to perform coreference
        resolution*, a Natural Language Processing task which consists of
        determining the mentions that refer to the same entity in a text or
        discourse. CorefGraph is a multilingual rule-based system loosely
        based on the Stanford Multi Sieve Coreference System
        [Stanford Multi Sieve Pass system (Lee et al., 2013)](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/downloads/dcoref.shtml).
        Currently it supports English and Spanish but it can be extended to other
        languages.
        
        The module provides resources for English and Spanish coreference resolution but
        it can be adapted to other languages.

        CorefGraph is being used by the [ixa pipes tools](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/ixa-pipes) which can be used to provide the necessary input.
