    Usage: cumulusci dev deploy [OPTIONS]

      running tests
    
    Options:
      --run-tests          If set, run tests as part of the deployment.  Defaults
                           to not running tests
      --full-delete        If set, delete all package metadata at the start of the
                           build instead of doing an incremental delete.
                           **WARNING**: This deletes all package metadata, use
                           with caution.  This option can be necessary if you have
                           reference issues during an incremental delete
                           deployment.
      --ee-org             If set, use the deployUnmanagedEE target which prepares
                           the code for loading into a production Enterprise
                           Edition org.  Defaults to False.

      --debug-logdir TEXT  A directory to store debug logs from each test class.
                           If specified, a TraceFlag is created which captures
                           debug logs.  When all tests have completed, the debug
                           logs are downloaded to the specified directory.  They
                           are then parsed to capture detail information on the
                           test.  See cumulusci dev deploy --json-output for more
                           details

      --no-exit    If True, do not exit on exception.  Instead, throw the
                   exception so the caller can handle it.  This is used to allow
                   for retrying a managed package installation if the package is
                   unavailable.  Defaults to False
      --help       Show this message and exit.

      --test-exclude TEXT  Similar to --test-match, but adds exclusions to the

      --debug-logdir TEXT  A directory to store debug logs from each test class.
                           If specified, a TraceFlag is created which captures
                           debug logs.  When all tests have completed, the debug
                           logs are downloaded to the specified directory.  They
                           are then parsed to capture detail information on the

      --json-output TEXT   If set, outputs test results data in json format to the

                           --debug-logs option.  The resulting json file contains
                           detailed information on the code execution structure of
                           each test method including cumulative limits usage both
                           inside and outside the startTest/stopTest context
