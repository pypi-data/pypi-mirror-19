Usage: cumulusci unmanaged_deploy [OPTIONS]

  Runs a full deployment of the code including unused stale package
  metadata, setting up dependencies, deploying the code, and optionally
  running tests

Options:
  --run-tests    If set, run tests as part of the deployment.  Defaults to not
                 running tests
  --full-delete  If set, delete all package metadata at the start of the build
                 instead of doing an incremental delete.  **WARNING**: This
                 deletes all package metadata, use with caution.  This option
                 can be necessary if you have reference issues during an
                 incremental delete deployment.
  --ee-org       If set, use the deployUnmanagedEE target which prepares the
                 code for loading into a production Enterprise Edition org.
                 Defaults to False.
  --deploy-only  If set, runs only the deployWithoutTest target.  Does not
                 clean the org, update dependencies, or run any tests.  This
                 option invalidates all other options
  --help         Show this message and exit.
Detected None build of branch None at commit None on None
Usage: cumulusci managed_deploy [OPTIONS] COMMIT PACKAGE_VERSION

  Installs a managed package version and optionally runs the tests from the
  installed managed package

Options:
  --run-tests  If True, run tests as part of the deployment.  Defaults to
               False
  --help       Show this message and exit.
Detected None build of branch None at commit None on None
Usage: cumulusci run_tests [OPTIONS]

  Run Apex tests in the target org via the Tooling API and report results.
  Defaults to running all unmanaged test classes ending in _TEST.

Options:
  --test-match TEXT    A SOQL like format value to match against the test
                       name.  Defaults to %_TEST.  You can use commas to
                       separate multiple values like
                       %_SMOKE_TESTS,%_LOAD_TESTS
  --test-exclude TEXT  Similar to --test-match, but adds exclusions to the
                       test name matching.  Defaults to no value.  You can use
                       commas to separate multiple values
  --namespace TEXT     If set, only search for tests inside the specified
                       namespace.  By default, all unmanaged tests are
                       searched
  --debug-logdir TEXT  A directory to store debug logs from each test class.
                       If specified, a TraceFlag is created which captures
                       debug logs.  When all tests have completed, the debug
                       logs are downloaded to the specified directory.  They
                       are then parsed to capture detail information on the
                       test.  See --json-output for more details
  --json-output TEXT   If set, outputs test results data in json format to the
                       specified file.  This option is most useful with the
                       --debug-logs option.  The resulting json file contains
                       detailed information on the code execution structure of
                       each test method including cumulative limits usage both
                       inside and outside the startTest/stopTest context
  --help               Show this message and exit.

  release tag

Options:
  --last-tag TEXT   Instead of looking for the last tag, you can manually
                    provide it.  This is useful if you skip a release and want
                    to build release notes going back 2 releases
