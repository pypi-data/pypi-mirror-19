The package *cypari* is a Python wrapper for the `PARI library
<http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/>`_, a computer algebra system for
number theory computations.  It is derived from the `corresponding
component
<http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/libs/sage/libs/pari/index.html>`_
of `Sage <http://www.sagemath.org>`_, but is independent of the rest of
Sage and can be used with any recent version of Python (except on Windows,
where 3.4 is currently the only supported version of Python 3).
