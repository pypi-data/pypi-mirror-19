Description: # dbThrottle
        Python Class to run code with consideration to DB load.
        
        ## Why
        Throttling code to work under the constraints of a server makes sense in certain situations, especially when replica lag comes into play. This project hopes to simplify acting on this consideration.
        
        ## What
        A, still early, python module, which introduces a functional type to complete a task or continiously run an operation, taking database load and similar metrics into account.
