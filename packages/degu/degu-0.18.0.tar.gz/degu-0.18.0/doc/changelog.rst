0.18 (December 2016)
--------------------

`Download Degu 0.18`_

Degu 0.18 focused on significant cleanup and refactoring in the `C extension`_.
There are no known breaking API changes, although there is a subtle change in
the semantics of the :attr:`degu.client.Connection.closed` attribute (more
details below).


Bug fixes:

    *   Fix goof caught running the unit tests under python3.5-dbg: the
        ``_Foo_New()`` functions should not have been calling
        ``PyObject_INIT()`` (C implementation only)

    *   Likewise fix a ``ResourceWarning`` goof caught running unit tests
        under python3.5-dbg (C implementation only)

    *   :attr:`degu.client.Connection.closed` will now be ``True`` after an
        error occurs when reading/writing a request body, or when an error
        occurs when reading/writing a response body.

        This fixes an important request-retry pattern used by `Microfiber`_,
        similar to this:

        >>> def request_with_retry(method, uri, headers, body, client, conn=None):
        ...     for retry in range(3):
        ...         try:
        ...             if conn is None or conn.closed:
        ...                 conn = client.connect()
        ...             return (conn.request(method, uri, headers, body), conn)
        ...         except ConnectionError as e:
        ...             pass
        ...     raise e
        ... 


Other changes:

    *   To prevent errors from again cropping up that can only be caught by
        running the unit tests under ``python3.*-dbg``, the Debian packaging now
        builds Degu and runs its unit test under the Python3 debug variant.

    *   As such, the Debian package now includes the new ``python3-degu-dbg``
        binary package.  This can be useful for debugging software built atop
        Degu, especially if such software itself has a C extension.

    *   The internal ``Reader`` and ``Writer`` classes were consolidated
        into the new ``SocketWrapper`` class.

    *   The new ``SocketWrapper`` class now includes its two 32 KiB buffers
        (one for reading and another for writing) in the Python object
        ``struct`` itself.  Previously the ``Reader`` and ``Writer`` classes
        separately allocated these buffers with ``calloc()``, and separately
        freed them with ``free()`` when the Python object was deallocated.  In
        addition to simplifying the implementation, this change means Degu can
        better take advantage of the Python memory allocator, which should
        generally result in reduced memory fragmentation, lower memory usage.

    *   The new ``SocketWrapper`` class only calls ``socket.close()`` when
        closing the underlying connection, no longer first calls
        ``socket.shutdown()``.  Use of ``socket.shutdown()`` may be revisited in
        the future, but for now it seems more problematic than beneficial.  If
        this change is problematic for you, or if you otherwise have better
        ideas, please `file a bug`_!



.. _version-0.17:

0.17 (October 2016)
-------------------

`Download Degu 0.17`_

Breaking API changes:

    *   The ``RouterApp`` class in the :mod:`degu.applib` module was renamed to
        :class:`degu.applib.Router`.

        This rename was done to correct naming ambiguity between RGI middleware
        components and RGI leaf applications.  The new name better reflects that
        :class:`degu.applib.Router` is an RGI middleware component (as opposed
        to :class:`degu.applib.ProxyApp`, which is an RGI leaf application).

    *   The public constructor for :class:`degu.server.Request` now does strict
        validation of the *method* argument, only allows the methods currently
        supported by the Degu client and server::

            {'GET', 'PUT', 'POST', 'HEAD', 'DELETE'}

        As the equivalent validation was already done when parsing an incoming
        request, this change does *not* break backward compatibility for
        existing Degu/RGI server applications during normal run-time operation.

        However, this change could potentially break the units tests for
        existing Degu/RGI server applications (depending on the nature of the
        unit tests).  In short, you can no longer construct a
        :class:`degu.server.Request` instance with a method that the Degu server
        would reject as invalid when parsing an incoming request.

        In the (rather unlikely) event that you had such unit tests, please
        consider using a mocked ``Request`` object.


Bug fixes:

    *   `lp:1590459`_ --- fix compilation of the Degu `C extension`_ under GCC
        6.

        The unused ``LF`` global (``_DEGU_SRC_CONSTANT()``) was dropped.  It
        wasn't needed, plus it caused the build to fail under the stricter
        checks done by GCC 6.

    *   When parsing a request, the Degu server now (again) only allows a
        request body when the request method is ``'PUT'`` or ``'POST'``.

        In other words, the Degu server will now reject any ``'GET'``,
        ``'HEAD'``, or ``'DELETE'`` requests that include a Content-Length or a
        Transfer-Encoding header.

        This properly restricts the Degu server to the long documented
        :ref:`http-subset` it aims to support.  In fact, the server in Degu 0.12
        and earlier did enforce these exact restrictions aside from one leniency
        (``'GET'`` and ``'HEAD'`` requests were allowed to have a Content-Length
        header, but only if that header value was ``'0'``).

        Degu 0.13 through Degu 0.16 mistakingly did not enforce these
        restrictions on the server-side, although Degu did still enforce them on
        the client-side (the Degu client would raise an exception instead of
        letting you send such a semantically fuzzy request to any server).

        This change does *not* break any Python API backward compatibility for
        Degu server or client consumers themselves.  This change likewise
        doesn't alter the allowed semantics when using the Degu client to make
        requests to a Degu server.

        But this change does potentially alter the allowed semantics when using
        *other* HTTP clients to connect to a Degu server.  If this change is
        problematic for your Degu server use-case, please `file a bug`_ with a
        strong rationale for why your use-case is important enough to support.


New API additions:

    *   The :class:`degu.applib.AllowedMethods` and
        :class:`degu.applib.MethodFilter` classes were added to the
        :mod:`degu.applib` module.

        Note that these new classes, along with everything else in the
        :mod:`degu.applib` module, are not yet API stable!  These items might
        yet still undergo backward-incompatible API changes, be renamed, or be
        removed entirely.

    *   :class:`degu.applib.Router` now supports nested *appmap* arguments, for
        example:

        >>> from degu.applib import Router
        >>> def my_app(session, request, api):
        ...     return (200, 'OK', {}, None)
        ... 
        >>> appmap = {
        ...     'a': {
        ...         'b': {
        ...             'c': {
        ...                 'd': {
        ...                     'e': my_app,
        ...                 },
        ...             },
        ...         },
        ...     },
        ... }
        ...
        >>> router = Router(appmap)

    *   The :func:`degu.misc.format_request()` and
        :func:`degu.misc.format_response()` functions were added.

        These two functions are aimed at unit-testing, benchmarking, and
        illustration.  They do not reflect the behavior of the real Degu
        backend, which does much stricter argument validation.


Performance improvements:

    *   :class:`degu.applib.Router` and :class:`degu.applib.ProxyApp` now have
        high-performance C implementations that are used when the Degu
        `C extension`_ is available.

        In part this is an effort to make sure the public Python API in
        :mod:`degu.applib` is constructed such that these standard Degu RGI
        components can be easily implemented as C extensions and, when needed,
        can reach within the internal C API for optimization purposes.

        But this is also just part of the continued effort to make sure the
        Degu client and server are highly optimized for everything that happens
        at a per-request frequency (or higher).  In real-world scenarios, these
        two new C implementations can provide noteworthy performance
        improvements when it comes to round-trip throughput for sequential
        requests made through the same connection (eg, a 10% performance
        improvement can easily be achieved in the right scenario).

    *   The C implementation of :meth:`degu.client.Connection.request()` and the
        related :class:`degu.client.Connection` request shortcut methods are now
        slightly faster.  Although the round-trip performance improvement is
        rather small (in the range of 1 to 2%), this was an easy change and the
        performance improvement can be greater in cache-constrained systems like
        a Raspberry Pi 2, etc.


Other changes:

    *   There was significant refactoring and cleanup in the Degu
        `C extension`_, in particular to support the new internal fast-paths
        used by the :class:`degu.applib.Router` and
        :class:`degu.applib.ProxyApp` C implementations.



.. _version-0.16:

0.16 (May 2016)
---------------

`Download Degu 0.16`_

Degu 0.16 again brings a number of small breaking API changes; however, the
changes in this release are quite unlikely to break the behavior Degu server and
client consumers during normal run-time use.  If any changes are needed to port
your applications to Degu 0.16, it will most likely be changes to your unit
tests.

Breaking API changes:

    *   The ``degu.base.Bodies`` namedtuple has been renamed to
        :class:`degu.base.API`, plus the new ``Range`` and ``ContentRange``
        attributes were added.

        This is another small step in making it possible to transparently run
        RGI server and client application code under different RGI compliant
        implementations.

        To achieve this, RGI server and client code should not directly import
        anything from :mod:`degu.base`.  This was mostly the case in Degu 0.15
        save for the :class:`degu.base.Range` and
        :class:`degu.base.ContentRange` classes.

        As such, ``Range`` and ``ContentRange`` attributes needed to be added
        to the namedtuple exposing the standard RGI API.

        Because this standard RGI API now exposes more that just IO abstraction
        classes for creating HTTP request and response bodies, it made sense to
        rename this namedtuple from ``Bodies`` to the more generic ``API``.

    *   The ``degu.base.bodies`` constant has been renamed to
        :data:`degu.base.api` and is now a :class:`degu.base.API` instance.

        The standard RGI API now exposes six classes:

        =======================  ==================================
        Attribute                Degu implementation
        =======================  ==================================
        ``api.Body``             :class:`degu.base.Body`
        ``api.ChunkedBody``      :class:`degu.base.ChunkedBody`
        ``api.BodyIter``         :class:`degu.base.BodyIter`
        ``api.ChunkedBodyIter``  :class:`degu.base.ChunkedBodyIter`
        ``api.Range``            :class:`degu.base.Range`
        ``api.ContentRange``     :class:`degu.base.ContentRange`
        =======================  ==================================
        

        Although this change does not break backward compatibility with RGI
        server applications, new applications should follow the new convention
        and use ``api`` for their 3rd argument name instead of ``bodies``.

        For example, change this::

            def my_app(session, request, bodies):
                my_body = bodies.BodyIter([b'hello, ', b' world'], 12)
                return (200, 'OK', {}, my_body)

        To this::

            def my_app(session, request, api):
                my_body = api.BodyIter([b'hello, ', b' world'], 12)
                return (200, 'OK', {}, my_body)

        For backward compatibility, ``degu.base.bodies`` is still available as
        as alias for :data:`degu.base.api`.  However, new applications should
        always use :data:`degu.base.api` instead of ``degu.base.bodies`` as the
        former is deprecated and will be removed in a future Degu release.

    *   The ``degu.client.Connection.bodies`` attribute has been renamed to
        :attr:`degu.client.Connection.api`.

        For example, change this::

            conn = client.connect()
            my_body = conn.bodies.BodyIter([b'hello, ', b' world'], 12)
            conn.request('POST', '/foo', {}, my_body)

        To this::

            conn = client.connect()
            my_body = conn.api.BodyIter([b'hello, ', b' world'], 12)
            conn.request('POST', '/foo', {}, my_body)

        For backward compatibility, ``degu.client.Connection.bodies`` is still
        available as as alias for :attr:`degu.client.Connection.api`.  However,
        new applications should always use :attr:`degu.client.Connection.api`
        instead of ``degu.client.Connection.bodies`` as the former is deprecated
        and will be removed in a future Degu release.

    *   :meth:`degu.server.Request.shift_path()` now returns ``None`` when
        :attr:`degu.server.Request.path` is empty (rather than raising an
        ``IndexError``).

        This change was made to make an important pattern in RGI routing
        middleware easier to capture, for example:

        >>> class RouterApp:
        ...     def __init__(self, appmap):
        ...         self.appmap = appmap
        ... 
        ...     def __call__(self, session, request, api):
        ...         handler = self.appmap.get(request.shift_path())
        ...         if handler is None:
        ...             return (410, 'Gone', {}, None)
        ...         return handler(session, request, api)
        ... 

        There is an unfortunate ambiguity in HTTP around URIs that end with a
        trailing ``'/'``.  For example, we'd like our routing application to
        behave the same whether it was mounted at ``'/'`` vs. ``'/foo'`` vs.
        ``'/foo/'``.

        Because :meth:`degu.server.Request.shift_path()` now returns ``None``
        when :attr:`degu.server.Request.path` is empty, the solution to this
        problem is easier because (when needed) an application can have entries
        in their routing map for both ``None`` and ``''``:

        >>> def my_index_app(session, request, api):
        ...     return (200, 'OK', {}, b'From the root app')
        ... 
        >>> def my_bar_app(session, request, api):
        ...     return (200, 'OK', {}, b'From the bar app')
        ... 
        >>> my_appmap = {
        ...     None:  my_index_app,
        ...     '':    my_index_app,
        ...     'bar': my_bar_app,
        ... }
        ... 
        >>> my_router = RouterApp(my_appmap)

    *   The ``read_chunk()`` and ``write_chunk()``  functions were removed from
        the :mod:`degu.base` module and dropped from the stable API.

        As these functions should never be needed by Degu server and client
        applications during normal run-time use, they didn't belong in
        :mod:`degu.base`.  In the future, equivalent functions might be added to
        the :mod:`degu.misc` module, simply to aid in unit testing and
        illustrations.

    *   The ``parse_headers()`` function was moved from the :mod:`degu.base`
        module to :func:`degu.misc.parse_headers()`.

        As this function should never be needed by Degu server and client
        applications during normal run-time use, it didn't belong in
        :mod:`degu.base`, is properly placed in :mod:`degu.misc`.

    *   The ``format_headers()`` function was moved from the :mod:`degu.base`
        module to :func:`degu.misc.format_headers()`.

        As this function should never be needed by Degu server and client
        applications during normal run-time use, it didn't belong in
        :mod:`degu.base`, is properly placed in :mod:`degu.misc`.

    *   The *base_headers* argument provided to the
        :class:`degu.client.Connection` constructor now must be a ``tuple`` of
        ``(key,value)`` pairs instead of a ``dict``.

        It's simpler and better defined for these *base_headers* to be provided
        by an immutable object.


New API additions:

    *   The :class:`degu.client.Client` and :class:`degu.client.SSLClient`
        constructors now take an optional *authorization* keyword option, which
        can be used to specify an HTTP Authorization header that will be
        unconditionally included in each HTTP request made by
        :meth:`degu.client.Connection.request()`.

        See :attr:`degu.client.Client.authorization` for details.

    *   The undocumented ``degu.client.Client._base_headers`` attribute has been
        renamed to :attr:`degu.client.Client.base_headers`, thus making it part
        of the formal API.  It was likewise changed from a ``dict`` to a
        ``tuple``, the same instance of which is passed as the *base_headers*
        argument to the :class:`degu.client.Connection` constructor.

    *   The :meth:`degu.client.Client.set_base_header()` method was added,
        providing a mechanism for 3rd-party applications to set addition base
        headers without adding new keyword *options* to the
        :class:`degu.client.Client` constructor.

    *   The :func:`degu.misc.mkreq()` function was added, which makes it easier
        to construct well-formed :class:`degu.server.Request` instances for
        unit-testing.

    *   The :func:`degu.misc.mkuri()` function was added, which makes it easier
        to build a valid HTTP request URI from RGI-like *path* and *query*
        components for unit-testing.

    *   The :mod:`degu.applib` module was added, with the goal of providing
        a library of RGI application and middleware components for common
        scenarios.

        This far, it contains two components:

            1.  :class:`degu.applib.RouterApp`

            2.  :class:`degu.applib.ProxyApp`

        Note that nothing in this module is yet API stable.



.. _version-0.15:

0.15 (March 2016)
-----------------

`Download Degu 0.15`_

Breaking API changes:

    *   :class:`degu.server.Request` is now a custom object rather than a
        ``namedtuple``.

        If your RGI server applications only accessed
        :class:`degu.server.Request` items via their attribute, this change
        should not break backward compatibility.

        However, if you were accessing request items via their index, or if you
        were otherwise relying on the properties a request had as a
        ``namedtuple`` or ``tuple``, you might need to update your RGI server
        applications.

        For example, usage like this::

            method = request[0]
            conn.request(*request[0:4])

        Needs to be ported to the following in Degu 0.15::

            method = request.method
            conn.request(request.method, request.uri, request.headers, request.body)

        Note that although the :class:`degu.server.Request()` constructor API
        remains the same, it now requires that the *mount* and *path* arguments
        both be ``list`` instances.  This is unlikely to cause compatibility
        breaks with normal run-time usage, but it might cause breakage in your
        unit-tests depending on how you wrote them.

        In general, this change might break some 3rd-party unit-tests, but it's
        unlikely to break the normal run-time behavior of any existing RGI
        server applications that worked with Degu 0.14.


New API additions:

    *   The :meth:`degu.server.Request.shift_path()` method was added.

        This is the successor to the :func:`degu.util.shift_path()` function,
        which itself was inspired by the ``wsgiref.util.shift_path_info()``
        function in the Python standard library.

        This change is a another small step in refining RGI as a standardized
        API by which independent RGI server applications and middleware can
        transparently run under multiple RGI server implementations.

        In my own experience writing WSGI applications, I would typically use
        the ``shift_path_info()`` implementation from the Python standard
        library, or occasionally I would implement my own equivalent.

        Although the above approach offers a nice amount a flexibility, in the
        case of Degu it makes RGI applications less portable because there is no
        RGI ``shift_path()`` implementation in the Python standard library.
        Plus it limits the ability of RGI servers to provide optimized versions
        of ``shift_path()`` that leverage the specific details of their
        ``Request`` object implementation.

        There is a somewhat difficult balance here.  As much as possible, I want
        all essential functionality to be exposed via API in the three RGI
        request handler arguments::

            (session, request, bodies)

        Yet at the same time, I especially want 3rd-party request routing
        libraries to be first class citizens.

        I believe that making ``shift_path()`` a method on the ``Request``
        object maintains this balance, that it facilitates better optimization
        and improved portability while still allowing 3rd-party request routing
        libraries to be first class citizens:

            1.  The ``Request.shift_path()`` method means one less global you
                need to import from some standard library, implement on your
                own, or import from the specific RGI server that your
                application is running under (which breaks portability between
                RGI server implementations).

            2.  The ``Request.shift_path()`` method allows specific RGI server
                implementations to optimize a critical code path that
                (potentially) executes with more than per-request frequency.

            3.  Yet the ``Request.mount`` and ``Request.path`` attributes are
                still standard Python ``list`` instances that can easily be
                mutated by 3rd-party request routing libraries.

        Note that existing RGI server applications can continue to use
        :func:`degu.util.shift_path()` for the time being, but you should
        strongly consider using :meth:`degu.server.Request.shift_path()` instead
        as the former might eventually be removed from the Degu API.

        One caveat when porting to :meth:`degu.server.Request.shift_path()` is
        that the ``IndexError`` message has changed when attempting to shift an
        empty path::

            'pop from empty list' --> 'Request.path is empty'

        For example, if you have this :class:`degu.server.Request`:

        >>> from degu.server import Request
        >>> request = Request('GET', '/', {}, None, [], [], None)

        You get this ``IndexError`` message when using
        :func:`degu.util.shift_path()`:

        >>> from degu.util import shift_path
        >>> shift_path(request)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          ...
        IndexError: pop from empty list

        But this you get this ``IndexError`` message when using
        :meth:`degu.server.Request.shift_path()`:

        >>> shift_path(request)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          ...
        IndexError: Request.path is empty

        Although the change in the ``IndexError`` message is unlikely to effect
        the normal run-time behavior of existing RGI server applications, you
        might need to update your unit tests when porting to the
        :meth:`degu.server.Request.shift_path()` method.

    *   The :meth:`degu.server.Request.build_proxy_uri()` method was added.

        This is the successor to the :func:`degu.util.relative_uri()` function.

        The rationale for adding this method is the same as the rationale above
        for adding the :meth:`degu.server.Request.shift_path()` method.

        Note that existing RGI server applications can continue to use
        :func:`degu.util.relative_uri()` for the time being, but you should
        strongly consider using :meth:`degu.server.Request.build_proxy_uri()`
        instead as the former might eventually be removed from the Degu API.

        There are several reason for changing the name to ``build_proxy_uri()``
        from ``relative_path()``:

            1.  Because ``build_proxy_uri()`` starts with a verb, it's clearer
                that it's a method rather than an attribute, which also
                harmonizes better with ``shift_path()``.

            2.  ``relative_uri()`` is confusing because it leads one to think
                the resulting URI wont start with a ``'/'``; in fact, the
                resulting URI itself is absolute (it starts with ``'/'``), but
                it's built relative to the mount-point at which the RGI
                application is called.

            3.  The name ``build_proxy_uri()`` ephasizes the scenario under
                which this method is most likely to be used... in RGI
                reverse-proxy applications.


Other changes:

    *   The default :attr:`degu.client.Client.timeout` is now ``65`` seconds
        (it was ``60`` seconds in Degu 0.14).

    *   The C extension is now built with ``-Wmissing-field-initializers``, plus
        corresponding fixes were made in ``_base.c``, ``_base.h``.

    *   In ``benchmark.py``, the client now doesn't include an HTTP Host header
        by default when benchmarking over ``AF_INET6``, which makes the
        comparison between ``AF_UNIX`` and ``AF_INET6`` more representative.

        You can use the ``--send-host`` option to force the old behavior::

            ./benchmark.py --send-host



0.14 (August 2015)
------------------

`Download Degu 0.14`_

Breaking API changes:

    *   The ``Request.script`` attribute on the :class:`degu.server.Request`
        namedtuple has been renamed to :attr:`degu.server.Request.mount`.  

        .. note::

            This is only a breaking API change if you were directly using the
            former ``Request.script`` attribute.  If you were doing your path
            shifting via :func:`degu.util.shift_path()`, no change is needed in
            your RGI server applications.  Likewise, if you were rebuilding an
            absolute URI via :func:`degu.util.absolute_uri()`, no change is
            needed.

        The ``Request.script`` attribute was so name as to be a familiar
        equivalent to the WSGI ``environ['SCRIPT_NAME']`` item.  However, even
        with WSGI, for which CGI compatibility was a design requirement, the
        name was something of an anachronism as it only made sense for the the
        CGI script "mount" point and was a rather awkward name considering the
        path-shifting that might be done after the HTTP request handling entered
        the WSGI domain.

        As the former ``Request.script`` attribute generally  wasn't used
        directly, this breaking change is fairly easy to justify.  The name
        "mount" does a better job of conveying a generic meaning applicable to
        both the "script" mount point and the path-shifting that might be done
        after entering the RGI domain.


Documentation improvements:

    *   :ref:`eg-routing` has been added to the tutorial, demonstrating RGI
        request routing using :func:`degu.util.shift_path()`.

    *   A new :ref:`server-logging` section has been added in the
        :mod:`degu.server` documentation, providing details on the
        per-connection logging done by the Degu server.


Other changes:

    *   Update a number of unit tests for Python 3.5 compatibility.

    *   The preamble validation tables now allow the bytes ``b'<'`` and ``b'>'``
        in header values (to accommodate the HTTP "Link" header).

    *   Cleanup the :mod:`degu.server` and :mod:`degu.client` modules so the
        stable API is more clearly defined, plus add a number of missing unit
        tests for the ``**options`` supported by :class:`degu.server.Server` and
        :class:`degu.client.Client`.

    *   Improve error message delivered by
        :meth:`degu.client.Connection.request()` when an unsupported HTTP method
        is used.  In Degu 0.13, it raised a ``ValueError`` like this::

            ValueError: bad HTTP method: b'FOO'

        This was because it used the same internal validation function used by
        the server when parsing the method out of the HTTP preamble.  But this
        has been fixed in Degu 0.14, which will now raise a ``ValueError`` like
        this::

            ValueError: bad method: 'FOO'

    *   Simplify error messages used in ``ValueError`` raised when the HTTP
        preamble contains an invalid Content-Length header value.  Degu 0.13
        had four different possible messages, used when the Content-Length:

            *   Was empty
            *   Was longer than 16 bytes (the longest Degu will attempt to parse)
            *   Contained invalid bytes
            *   Had leading zeros and wasn't ``b'0'``

        Degu 0.14 reduces this to just two error messages: one for when it's too
        long, another for when it's invalid.  As such, the error behavior when
        parsing a Content-Length now matches the error behavior when parsing
        a Range or Content-Range header.



0.13 (May 2015)
---------------

`Download Degu 0.13`_

Degu 0.13 has a completely re-written C backend, bringing with it dramatic
performance improvements.  However, Degu 0.13 also brings a number breaking API
changes.

Users of the Degu 0.12 client API are unlikely to be affected by the changes in
0.13.

But there are two critical changes that affect anyone who implemented RGI server
applications atop Degu 0.12:

    1. Instead of a ``dict``, the RGI *request* argument is now a namedtuple,
       requiring the following porting::

            request['method']  --> request.method
            request['uri']     --> request.uri
            request['headers'] --> request.headers
            request['body']    --> request.body
            request['script']  --> request.script
            request['path']    --> request.path
            request['query']   --> request.query

    2. Instead of a ``dict``, the RGI *session* argument is now a custom object
       with read-only attributes, requiring the following porting::

            session['client']   --> session.address
            session['requests'] --> session.requests
            session[my_key]     --> session.store[my_key]

(See below for more details on these breaking API changes.)


Performance improvements:

    *   Compared to Degu 0.12, ``benchmark.py`` (as measured on an Intel
        i7-4900MQ) is now on average:

            *   141% faster for ``AF_UNIX``

            *   118% faster for ``AF_INET6``

        These numbers come from a 50-run test where each run made 50,000
        sequential requests (reusing the same connection).  In this test, Degu
        achieved an average of:

            *   76,899 requests per second over ``AF_UNIX``

            *   53,369 requests per second over ``AF_INET6``

        This level of performance means that now more than ever, Degu is
        perfectly viable for network-transparent IPC.  If you build a service
        atop Degu, both local and remote clients get the same, uniform HTTP
        goodness, even when a local client connects over ``AF_UNIX`` for the
        very best performance.


Breaking API changes:

    *   Instead of a ``dict``, the RGI *request* argument is now a
        :class:`degu.server.Request` namedtuple.  For example, this Degu 0.12
        server application::

            def my_app(session, request, bodies):
                if request['path'] != []:
                    return (404, 'Not Found', {}, None)
                if request['method'] == 'GET':
                    return (200, 'OK', {}, b'hello, world')
                if request['method'] == 'HEAD':
                    return (200, 'OK', {'content-length': 12}, None)
                return (405, 'Method Not Allowed', {}, None)

        Is implemented like this is Degu 0.13::

            def my_app(session, request, bodies):
                if request.path != []:
                    return (404, 'Not Found', {}, None)
                if request.method == 'GET':
                    return (200, 'OK', {}, b'hello, world')
                if request.method == 'HEAD':
                    return (200, 'OK', {'content-length': 12}, None)
                return (405, 'Method Not Allowed', {}, None)

        This change was made for brevity and improved readability in RGI server
        application code.  The 3rd option here is a lot more appealing when
        you're typing (or reading) it over and over::

            environ['PATH_INFO']  # WSGI
            request['path']       # RGI (Degu 0.12)
            request.path          # RGI (Degu 0.13)

        It also feels cleaner for the request object to be immutable.  For
        example, now something like the :class:`degu.rgi.Validator` class
        doesn't need to worry about whether the downstream RGI application has
        replaced any of the request attributes when, say, checking the URI
        invariant condition.

    *   Instead of a ``dict``, the RGI *session* argument is now a
        :class:`degu.server.Session` object with read-only attributes.  However,
        the :attr:`degu.server.Session.store` attribute provides a ``dict``
        instance that RGI connection and request handlers can still use for
        persistent, per-connection storage.

        For ``app.on_connect()`` connection handlers, port your *session*
        storage like this::

            session['_key'] --> session.store['_key']

        And for ``app()`` request handlers, port your *session* storage like
        this::

            session['__key'] --> session.store['key']

        (Note that in Degu 0.13, keys in ``session.store`` will never conflict
        with any server provided information, so there's no need for request
        handlers to prefix their keys with ``'__'``; however, as a matter of
        convention, it's still recommended that connection handlers prefix their
        keys with ``'_'`` to avoid conflict and confusion with keys added by
        request handlers.)

        Finally, the server-provided information in the *session* is ported like
        this::

            session['client'] --> session.address
            session['requests'] --> session.requests

        (Note that "client" was renamed to "address" as the new *session* object
        also exposes a *credentials* attribute, which will be a
        ``(pid,uid,gid)`` 3-tuple for ``AF_UNIX``, and will be ``None`` for
        ``AF_INET`` or ``AF_INET6``; as there are now two pieces of information
        provided about the connecting client, the term "client" is ambiguous;
        also, the meaning of "address" is clearer because it's used consistently
        elsewhere in the Degu API.)

        This change was primarily made to split the per-connection *session*
        into two, non-conflicting domains:

            1.  Read-only information provided by the server

            2.  Mutable free-form key/value storage for use by RGI connection
                and request handlers

        But this change was also made to accommodate API additions that might
        come later.

    *   When the server receives a request with a Range header, its value is
        converted to a :class:`degu.base.Range` instance:

        >>> from degu.misc import parse_headers
        >>> parse_headers(b'Range: bytes=3-8')
        {'range': Range(3, 9)}

        And, to tighten up the semantics here, the client will no longer accept
        a Range header in the response headers (a ``ValueError`` is raised).

        (See :ref:`eg-range-requests` in the tutorial.)

    *   When the client receives a response with a Content-Range header, its
        value is converted to a :class:`degu.base.ContentRange` instance:

        >>> from degu.misc import parse_headers
        >>> parse_headers(b'Content-Range: bytes 3-8/12', isresponse=True)
        {'content-range': ContentRange(3, 9, 12)}

        Plus the server will no longer accept a Content-Range header in the
        request headers (a ``ValueError`` is raised).

        (Again, see :ref:`eg-range-requests` in the tutorial.)

    *   A ``bytearray`` can no longer be used as an output body.  This applies
        both to request bodies on the client-side and to response bodies on the
        server-side.  If you previously used a ``bytearray`` to build-up your
        output body, you'll now need to convert it to ``bytes`` after the
        build-up, for example::

            body = bytearray()
            body.extend(b'foo')
            body.extend(b'bar')
            body = bytes(body)

        There wasn't a clear enough use-case to justify ``bytearray`` as an
        output body type, so in order to minimize the stable API commitments,
        it makes sense to drop this option for now.

        However, it may be added back in the future if a good rationale is put
        forward.  And if support for a ``bytearray`` can be justified, we can
        probably justify adding support for arbitrary Python objects that
        support the buffer protocol (eg., also support ``memoryview``, etc.).

    *   :class:`degu.base.Body` and :class:`degu.base.ChunkedBody` now require
        their *rfile* to have a ``readinto()`` method, no longer use the
        ``read()`` method.

        However, most all Python "file-like" objects implement a ``readinto()``
        method, so for most folks, this is unlikely to cause any breakage.

    *   The ``body.closed`` attribute has been dropped from the four HTTP body
        classes:

            * :class:`degu.base.Body`
            * :class:`degu.base.ChunkedBody`
            * :class:`degu.base.BodyIter`
            * :class:`degu.base.ChunkedBodyIter`

        The more generic ``body.state`` attribute has replaced ``body.closed``
        for Degu internal use, but the ``body.state`` attribute isn't yet
        considered part of the public API and might yet experience breaking
        changes.

        However, if you relied on the ``closed`` attribute to determine whether
        a body was fully consumed (say, in unit tests), you can do a stop-gap
        port to Degu 0.13 with::

            (body.closed is True) --> (body.state == 2)

        Although the ``body.state`` attribute *probably* wont be renamed or
        removed on the road to Degu 1.0, there is no guarantee yet.  It is
        documented is its current, non-stable form simply to help you port
        unit-tests.

        The most likely change between now and 1.0 is that the internal
        ``BODY_CONSUMED`` constant might not have the value ``2``.

        Once these details are finalized, the ``BODY_CONSUMED`` constant (or
        whatever its final name is) will be exposed as part of the stable,
        public API, as it can be quite handy for unit-tests especially.

    *   The optional *io_size* kwarg has been dropped from
        :meth:`degu.base.Body()`.

        For now the *io_size* is being treated as an internal constant, although
        it may again be exposed in some fashion after the Degu 1.0 release.

        Note this is only a breaking change if you were specifying the optional
        *io_size*.  Also, the internal value still matches the previous default
        value (1 MiB).

    *   Although not previously documented, the ``__len__()`` method has been
        dropped from :class:`degu.base.Body` and :class:`degu.base.BodyIter`.

        The idea behind the ``__len__()`` method was to provide a unified way of
        getting the content-length from any length-encoded output body type.
        However, this doesn't play nice with the Python C API object protocol
        where the value is constrained to *Py_ssize_t*::

            ssize_t length = PyObject_Length(body);

        This means that on 32-bit systems, the maximum output body size would
        be limited to 2 GiB, which is clearly insufficient for `Dmedia`_
        considering it already supports files up to 9 PB in size.

    *   :meth:`degu.client.Client()` and :meth:`degu.server.Server()` no longer
        accept the *bodies* keyword configuration option.

        Likewise, :meth:`degu.client.Client.connect()` and
        :meth:`degu.client.Connection()` no longer accept a *bodies* argument.

        This means the Degu client and server are no longer compossible with
        respect to potential 3rd-party implementations of the RGI bodies API.

        This feature was primarily dropped because it added a lot of complexity
        for something may never see real-word use.  Should a clear need for this
        feature arise later, it can be added without breaking backward
        compatibility, but the reverse isn't true.

        The original motivation for this compossibility was to make it possible
        to write a server-agnostic RGI reverse-proxy application.  At the time
        RGI was viewed only as a server-side specification, so the assumption
        was that an RGI compatible implementation would provide the server-side
        equivalent of Degu but not the client-side equivalent, 

        But another approach is for RGI to specify the client-side API as well.
        That way application components could still potentially use other
        implementations, just not necessarily mix and match the server, client,
        and bodies of different implementations.

        Most of code Degu is in the common backend, while there is surprisingly
        little code that is only used by the server or only used by the client.
        Experience shows that if you've implemented an RGI compatible server,
        it should be a relatively small step to implement an RGI compatible
        client (especially if that's your plan from the beginning).

        Although the *bodies* option has been dropped, most of the same guidance
        from 0.12 still applies for making implementation-agnostic RGI
        components.

        Rather than directly importing anything from :mod:`degu.base`, server
        components should use the bodies API via the *bodies* argument provided
        to their ``app()`` callable

        And Client components should use the bodies API via the
        :attr:`degu.client.Connection.bodies` attribute.

    *   The ``chunked`` attributed has been dropped from
        :class:`degu.base.BodyIter` and :class:`degu.base.ChunkedBodyIter`.

        As these classes are only used to specify HTTP output bodies, and as
        Degu doesn't interally use this attribute any more, it makes sense to
        drop it for now.

        However, the ``chunked`` attributed is still available on the two
        classes used also for HTTP input bodies:

            *   :attr:`degu.base.Body.chunked`
            *   :attr:`degu.base.ChunkedBody.chunked`

        These attributes allow you to test whether or not an HTTP input body
        uses chunked Transfer-Encoded, without having to test the exact Python
        type.


Other changes:

    *   The :meth:`degu.client.Connection.get_range()` method was added.

        See :ref:`eg-range-requests` in the tutorial.



0.12 (December 2014)
--------------------

`Download Degu 0.12`_

Performance improvements:

    *   ``benchmark.py`` is now on average around 24% faster for ``AF_INET6``
        and around 31% faster for ``AF_UNIX`` (as measured on an Intel
        i7-4900MQ).

        This performance increase is due to new C extensions for formatting the
        HTTP request and response preambles, and due to some new C parsing
        helpers.

        Note that ``benchmark.py`` has been tweaked to be more representative of
        idiomatic Degu use (very few headers), and also tweaked to deliver more
        consistent results, so to compare performance with Degu 0.11, you'll
        need to copy the ``benchmark.py`` script from the Degu 0.12 source tree.


Other changes:

    *   The :class:`degu.client.Client` *timeout* option now defaults to ``60``
        seconds (previously the default was ``90`` seconds).

    *   :class:`degu.client.Client` now supports a tentative *on_connect*
        option, which will become the client-side equivalent of
        ``app.on_connect()``.

        .. warning::

            This client-side *on_connect* option isn't yet part of the stable
            API and might still undergo breaking changes before taking its final
            form!

        Still, `your feedback`_ is welcome!  If you want to experiment with the
        tentative API, your *on_connect* option must be a callable accepting a
        single argument, something like this::

            def on_connect(conn):
                # Do something interesting when using SSL?
                der_encoded_cert = conn.sock.getpeercert(True)

                # Or perform special per-connection authentication?
                response = conn.post('/_authenticate', {}, my_special_token)
                if response.status != 200:
                    raise Exception('could not authenticate')

                return True  # Must return True to accept connection

        The *conn* argument will be the :class:`degu.client.Connection` created
        by :meth:`degu.client.Client.connect()`.

        If your *on_connect* handler does not return ``True``, the connection is
        closed and a ``ValueError`` is raised.

        When provided, an *on_connect* handler is called after
        :meth:`degu.client.Client.connect()` has created the new
        :class:`degu.client.Connection`, but before this new connection is
        returned.

        As hinted at in the above example, one of the interesting use-cases
        being explored is that your *on_connect* handler could itself make one
        or more requests to perform special per-connection authentication or
        negotiation as required by the server, before the connection is returned
        to the consumer.  The goal is to keep the end consumer of the connection
        completely abstracted from whether an *on_connect* handler is being
        used, and completely abstracted from what such an *on_connect* handler
        might have done.

        But again, fair warning: there may still be backward-incompatible API
        changes when it comes to this tentative client *on_connect* option!



0.11 (November 2014)
--------------------

`Download Degu 0.11`_

Degu is now *tentatively* API-stable.

Although no further backward incompatible changes are currently expected on the
way to the 1.0 release, it seems prudent to allow another release or two for
feedback and refinement, and for potential breaking API changes if deemed
absolutely essential.

If you were waiting for the API-stable release to experiment with Degu, now is
definitely the time to jump in, as `your feedback`_ can help better tune Degu
for your use-case.

It's quite possible that there will be no breaking API changes whatsoever
between Degu 0.11 and Degu 1.0, but even if there are, and even if those
breaking changes happen to effect your application, they will be subtle changes
that require only minimal porting effort.

Breaking API changes:

    *   Flip order of items in a single chunk (in an HTTP body using chunked
        transfer-encoding) from::

            (data, extension)

        To::

            (extension, data)

        This was the one place where the Degu API wasn't faithful to the order
        in the HTTP wire format (the chunk *extension*, when present, is
        contained in the chunk size line, prior to the actual chunk *data*).

        As before, the *extension* will be ``None`` when there is no extension
        for a specific chunk::

            (None, b'hello, world')

        And the *extension* will be a ``(key, value)`` tuple when a specific
        chunk does contain an optional per-chunk extension::

            (('foo', 'bar'), b'hello, world')

    *   Change :func:`degu.base.write_chunk()` signature from::

            write_chunk(wfile, data, extension=None)

        To::

            write_chunk(wfile, chunk)

        Where the *chunk* is an ``(extension, data)`` tuple.  This harmonizes
        with the above change, and also means that you can treat the *chunk* as
        an opaque data structure when passing it between
        :func:`degu.base.read_chunk()` and :func:`degu.base.write_chunk()`, for
        example::

            chunk = read_chunk(rfile)
            write_chunk(wfile, chunk)

    *   :meth:`degu.base.Body.read()` will now raise a ``ValueError`` if the
        resulting read would exceed :attr:`degu.base.MAX_READ_SIZE` (currently
        16 MiB); this is to prevent unbounded resource usage when no *size* is
        provided, a common pattern when a relatively small input body is
        expected, for example::

            doc = json.loads(body.read().decode())

    *   :meth:`degu.base.ChunkedBody.read()` will likewise now raise a
        ``ValueError`` when the accumulated size of chunks read thus far exceeds
        :attr:`degu.base.MAX_READ_SIZE`; this is to prevent unbounded resource
        usage for the same pattern above, which is especially important as the
        total size of a chunk-encoded input body can't be determined in advance.

        Note that in the near future :meth:`degu.base.ChunkedBody.read()` will
        accept an optional *size* argument, which can be done without breaking
        backward compatibility.  Once this happens, it will exactly match the
        semantics of of :meth:`degu.base.Body.read()`, and will meet standard
        Python file-like API exceptions.

    *   :meth:`degu.base.ChunkedBody.read()` now returns a ``bytes`` instance
        instead of a ``bytearray``, to match standard Python file-like API
        expectations.

    *   Fix ambiguity in RGI ``request['query']`` so that it can represent the
        difference between "no query" vs merely an "empty query".

        When there is *no* query, ``request['query']`` will now be ``None``
        (whereas previously it would be ``''``).  For example::

            request = {
                'method': 'GET',
                'uri': '/foo/bar',
                'script': [],
                'path': ['foo', 'bar'],
                'query': None,
                'body': None,
            }

        As before, an *empty* query is still represented via an empty ``str``::

            request = {
                'method': 'GET',
                'uri': '/foo/bar?',
                'script': [],
                'path': ['foo', 'bar'],
                'query': '',
                'body': None,
            }

        This change means it's now possible to exactly reconstructed the
        original URI from the ``request['script']``, ``request['path']``, and
        ``request['query']`` components.

    *   :func:`degu.util.relative_uri()` and :func:`degu.util.absolute_uri()`
        now preserve the difference between *no* query vs merely an *empty*
        query, can always reconstruct a lossless relative URI, or a lossless
        absolute URI, respectively.

    *   :meth:`degu.rgi.Validator.__call__()` now requires that
        ``request['uri']`` be present and be a ``str`` instance; it also
        enforces an invariant condition between ``request['script']``,
        ``request['path']``, and ``request['query']`` on the one hand, and
        ``request['uri']`` on the other::

            _reconstruct_uri(request) == request['uri']

        This invariant condition is initially checked to ensure that the RGI
        server correctly parsed the URI and that any path shifting was done
        correctly by (possible) upstream middleware; then this invariant
        condition is again checked after calling the downstream ``app()``
        request handler, to make sure that any path shifting was done correctly
        by (possible) downstream middleware.

    *   Demote ``read_preamble()`` function in :mod:`degu.base` to internal,
        private use API, as it isn't expected to be part of the eventual public
        parsing API (it will be replaced by some other equivalent once the C
        backend is complete).

    *   :class:`degu.client.Client` no longer accepts the *Connection* keyword
        option, no longer has the ``Client.Connection`` attribute; the idea
        behind the *Connection* option was so that high-level, domain-specific
        APIs could be implemented via a :class:`degu.client.Connection`
        subclass, but subclassing severely limits compossibility; in contrast,
        the new approach is inspired by the `io`_ module in the Python standard
        library (see :ref:`high-level-client-API` for details).


Other changes:

    *   Clarify and document the preferred approach for implementing high-level,
        domain-specific wrappers atop the Degu client API; see
        :ref:`high-level-client-API` for details.

    *   :class:`degu.client.Connection` now has shortcuts for the five supported
        HTTP request methods:

            *   :meth:`degu.client.Connection.put()`
            *   :meth:`degu.client.Connection.post()`
            *   :meth:`degu.client.Connection.get()`
            *   :meth:`degu.client.Connection.head()`
            *   :meth:`degu.client.Connection.delete()`

        Previously these were avoided to prevent confusion with specialized
        methods of the same name that would likely be added in
        :class:`degu.client.Connection` subclasses, as sub-classing was the
        expected way to implement high-level, domain-specific APIs; however, the
        new wrapper class approach for high-level APIs is much cleaner, and it
        eliminates confusion about which implementation of a method you're
        getting (because unlike a subclass, a wrapper wont inherit anything from
        :class:`degu.client.Connection`); as such, there's no reason to avoid
        these shortcuts any longer, plus they make the
        :class:`degu.client.Connection` API more inviting to use directly, so
        there's no reason to use a higher-level wrapper just for the sake of
        this same brevity.

        Note that the generic :meth:`degu.client.Connection.request()` method
        remains unchanged, and should still be used whenever you need to specify
        an arbitrary HTTP request via arguments alone (for example, when
        implementing a reverse-proxy).

    *   :class:`degu.client.Connection` now internally uses the provided
        *bodies* API rather than directly importing the default wrapper classes
        from :mod:`degu.base`; this means the standard client and bodies APIs
        are now fully compossible, so you can use the Degu client with other
        implementations of the bodies API (for example, when using the Degu
        client in a reverse-proxy running on some other RGI compatible server).

        To maintain this composability when constructing HTTP request bodies,
        you should use the wrappers exposed via
        :attr:`degu.client.Connection.bodies` (rather than directly importing
        the same from :mod:`degu.base`).  For example:

        >>> from degu.client import Client
        >>> client = Client(('127.0.0.1', 56789))
        >>> conn = client.connect()  #doctest: +SKIP
        >>> fp = open('/my/file', 'rb')  #doctest: +SKIP
        >>> body = conn.bodies.Body(fp, 76)  #doctest: +SKIP
        >>> response = conn.request('POST', '/foo', {}, body)  #doctest: +SKIP

    *   :class:`degu.server.Server` now internally uses the provided *bodies*
        API rather than directly importing the default wrapper classes from
        :mod:`degu.base`; this means the standard server and bodies APIs are
        now fully compossible, so you can use the Degu server with other
        implementations of the bodies API.

    *   :meth:`degu.server.Server.serve_forever()` now uses a
        `BoundedSemaphore`_ to limit the active TCP connections (and therefore
        worker threads) to at most :attr:`degu.server.Server.max_connections`
        (this replaces the yucky ``threading.active_count()`` hack); when the
        *max_connections* limit has been reached, the new implementation also
        now rate-limits the handling of new connections to one attempt every 2
        seconds (to mitigate Denial of Service attacks).

    *   Build the ``degu._base`` `C extension`_ with "-std=gnu11" as this will
        soon be the GCC default and we don't necessarily want to make a
        commitment to it working with older standards (although it currently
        does and this wont likely change anytime soon).



0.10 (October 2014)
-------------------

`Download Degu 0.10`_


Breaking API changes:

    *   Change order of the RGI ``app.on_connect()`` arguments from::

            app.on_connect(sock, session)

        To::

            app.on_connect(session, sock)

        Especially when you look at the overall API structurally, this change
        makes it a bit easier to understand that the same *session* argument
        passed to your TCP connection handler is likewise passed to your HTTP
        request handler::

            app.on_connect(session, sock)

                       app(session, request, bodies)

        See the new ``Degu-API.svg`` diagram in the Degu source tree for a good
        structural view of the API.

    *   :meth:`degu.client.Connection.request()` now requires the *headers* and
        *body* arguments always to be provided; ie., the method signature has
        changed from::

            Connection.request(method, uri, headers=None, body=None)

        To::

            Connection.request(method, uri, headers, body)

        Although this means some code is a bit more verbose, it forces people to
        practice the full API and means that any given example someone
        encounters illustrates the full client request API; ie., this is always
        clear::

            conn.request('GET', '/', {}, None)

        Whereas this leaves a bit too much to the imagination when trying to
        figure out how to specify the request headers and request body::

            conn.request('GET', '/')

        This seems especially important as the order of the *headers* and *body*
        are flipped in Degu compared to `HTTPConnection.request()`_ in the
        Python standard library::

            HTTPConnection.request(method, url, body=None, headers={})

        The reason Degu flips the order is so that its API faithfully reflects
        the HTTP wire format... Degu arguments are always in the order that they
        are serialized in the TCP stream.  A goal has always been that if you
        know the HTTP wire format, it should be extremely easy to map that
        understanding into the Degu API.

        Post Degu 1.0, we could always again make the *headers* and *body*
        optional without breaking backword compatibility, but the reverse isn't
        true.  So we'll let this experiment run for a while, and then
        reevaluate.

    *   Drop the ``create_client()`` and ``create_sslclient()`` functions from
        the :mod:`degu.client` module; these convenience functions allowed you
        to create a :class:`degu.client.Client` or
        :class:`degu.client.SSLClient` from a URL, for example::

            client = create_client('http://example.com/')
            sslclient = create_sslclient(sslctx, 'https://example.com/')

        These functions were in part justified as an easy way to set the "host"
        request header when connecting to a server that always requires it (eg.,
        Apache2), but now :attr:`degu.client.Client.host` and the keyword-only
        *host* option provide a much better solution.

        Using a URL to specify a server is really a Degu anti-pattern that we
        don't want to invite, because there's no standard way to encoded the
        IPv6 *flowinfo* and *scopeid* in a URL, nor is there a standard way to
        represent ``AF_UNIX`` socket addresses in a URL.

        Whether by *url* or *address*, the way you specify a server location
        will tend to find its way into lots of 3rd-party code.  We want people
        to use the generic client :ref:`client-address` argument because that's
        the only way they can tranparently use link-local IPv6 addresses and
        ``AF_UNIX`` addresses, both of which you loose with a URL.

    *   :class:`degu.client.Client` and :class:`degu.client.SSLClient` no longer
        take a *base_headers* argument; at best it was an awkward way to set the
        "host" (a header that might truly be justified in every request), and at
        worst, *base_headers* invited another Degu anti-pattern (unconditionally
        including certain headers in every request); the "Degu way" is to do
        special authentication or negotiation per-connection rather than
        per-request (when possible), and to otherwise use request headers
        sparingly in order to minimize the HTTP protocol overhead

    *   If you create a :class:`degu.client.Client` with a 2-tuple or 4-tuple
        :ref:`client-address`, :meth:`degu.client.Connection.request()` will now
        by default include a "host" header in the HTTP request.  This means that
        the Degu client now works by default with servers that require the
        "host" header in every request (like Apache2).  However, you can still
        set the "host" header to ``None`` using the *host* keyword option.

        See :attr:`degu.client.Client.host` for details.

    *   :class:`degu.misc.TempServer` now takes the exact same arguments as
        :class:`degu.server.Server`, no longer uses a *build_func* to create
        the server :ref:`server-app`::

            TempServer(address, app, **options)
                Server(address, app, **options)

        Although the *build_func* and *build_args* in the previous API did
        capture an important pattern for embedding a Degu server in a production
        application, :class:`degu.misc.TempServer` isn't for production use,
        should just illustrate the :class:`degu.server.Server` API as clearly as
        possible.

    *   :class:`degu.misc.TempSSLServer` now takes (with one restiction) the
        exact same arguments as :class:`degu.server.SSLServer`, no longer uses a
        *build_func* to create the server :ref:`server-app`.

        The one restriction is that :class:`degu.misc.TempSSLServer` only
        accepts an *sslconfig* ``dict`` as its first argument, whereas
        :class:`degu.server.SSLServer` accepts either an *sslconfig* ``dict`` or
        an *sslctx* (pre-built ``ssl.SSLContext``)::

            TempSSLServer(sslconfig, address, app, **options)
                SSLServer(sslconfig, address, app, **options)
                SSLServer(sslctx,    address, app, **options)

        Although the *build_func* and *build_args* in the previous API did
        capture an important pattern for embedding a Degu server in a production
        application, :class:`degu.misc.TempSSLServer` isn't for production use,
        should just illustrate the :class:`degu.server.SSLServer` API as clearly
        as possible.

    *   In :mod:`degu`, demote ``start_server()`` and ``start_sslserver()``
        functions to private, internal-use API, replacing them with:

            * :class:`degu.EmbeddedServer`
            * :class:`degu.EmbeddedSSLServer`

        When garbage collected, instances of these classes will automatically
        terminate the process, similar to :class:`degu.misc.TempServer` and
        :class:`degu.misc.TempSSLServer`.

        Not only are these classes easier to use, they also make it much easier
        to add new functionality in the future without breaking backword
        compatability.

        The ``(process, address)`` 2-tuple returned by ``start_server()`` and
        ``start_sslserver()`` was a far too fragile API agreement.  For example,
        even just needing another value from the background process would mean
        using a 3-tuple, which would break the API.

    *   Rename *config* to *sslconfig* as used internally in the sslctx
        build functions:

            * :func:`degu.server.build_server_sslctx()`
            * :func:`degu.client.build_client_sslctx()`

        This is only a breaking API change if you have unit tests that check the
        the exact error strings used in TypeError and ValueError these functions
        raise.  In these messages, you'll now need to use ``sslconfig`` in place
        of ``config``.

    *   Replace previous :class:`degu.misc.TempPKI` *get_foo_config()* methods
        with *foo_sslconfig* properties, to be consistent with the above naming
        convention change, yet still be a bit less verbose::

            pki.get_server_config()
            pki.server_sslconfig

            pki.get_client_config()

            pki.get_anonymous_server_config()
            pki.anonymous_server_sslconfig

Other changes:

    *   :class:`degu.client.Client` and :class:`degu.client.SSLClient` now
        accept generic and easily extensible keyword-only *options*::

                       Client(address, **options)
            SSLClient(sslctx, address, **options)

        *host*, *timeout*, *bodies*, and *Connection* are the currently
        supported keyword-only *options*, which are exposed via new attributes
        with the same name:

            * :attr:`degu.client.Client.host`
            * :attr:`degu.client.Client.timeout`
            * :attr:`degu.client.Client.bodies`
            * :attr:`degu.client.Client.Connection`

        See the client :ref:`client-options` for details.


    *   :class:`degu.server.Server` and :class:`degu.server.SSLServer` now also
        accepts generic and easily extensible keyword-only *options*::

                       Server(address, app, **options)
            SSLServer(sslctx, address, app, **options)

        See the server :ref:`server-options` for details.


    *   The RGI *request* argument now includes a ``uri`` item, which will be
        the complete, unparsed URI from the request line, for example::

            request = {
                'method': 'GET',
                'uri': '/foo/bar/baz?stuff=junk',
                'script': ['foo'],
                'path': ['bar', 'baz'],
                'query': 'stuff=junk',
                'headers': {'accept': 'text/plain'},
                'body': None,
            }

        ``request['uri']`` was added so that RGI validation middleware can check
        that the URI was properly parsed and that any path shifting was done
        correctly.  It's also handy for logging.


    *   :func:`degu.server.build_server_sslctx()` and
        :func:`degu.client.build_client_sslctx()` now unconditionally set the
        *ciphers* to::

            'ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384'

        Arguably AES128 is more secure than AES256 (especially because it's more
        resistant to timing attacks), plus it's faster.  However, SHA384 is
        certainly more secure than SHA256, both because it uses a 512-bit vs.
        256-bit internal state size, and because it's not vulnerable to message
        extension attacks (because the internal state is truncated to produce 
        the digest).  SHA384 is also faster than SHA256 on 64-bit hardware.

        If openssl supported it, this would be our default::

            'ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA384'

        However, on the balance, ``'ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256'`` still feels
        like the best choice, especially because of the better performance it
        offers.

        Note that as ``'ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384'`` is still supported as an
        option, Degu 0.10 remains network compatible with Degu 0.9 and earlier.

        Post Degu 1.0, we'll likely make it possible to specify the *ciphers*
        via your *sslconfig*, which can be done without breaking backward
        compatibility.



0.9 (September 2014)
--------------------

`Download Degu 0.9`_

Security fixes:

    *   :func:`degu.base.read_preamble()` now carefully restricts what bytes are
        allowed to exist in the first line, header names, and header values; in
        particular, this function now prevents the NUL byte (``b'\x00'``) from
        being included in any decoded ``str`` objects; for details, please see
        :doc:`security`

    *   :func:`degu.base.read_chunk()` likewise prevents the NUL byte
        (``b'\x00'``) from being included in the optional per-chunk extension

    *   :class:`degu.server.Server` now limits itself to 100 active threads (ie,
        100 concurrent connections) to prevent unbounded resource usage; this is
        hard-coded in 0.9 but will be configurable in 1.0


Breaking API changes:

    *   The RGI request signature is now ``app(session, request, bodies)``, and
        wrapper classes like ``session['rgi.Body']`` have moved to
        ``bodies.Body``, etc.

        For example, this Degu 0.8 RGI application::

            def my_file_app(session, request):
                myfile = open('/my/file', 'rb')
                body = session['rgi.Body'](myfile, 42)
                return (200, 'OK', {}, body)

        Is implemented like this in Degu 0.9::

            def my_file_app(session, request, bodies):
                myfile = open('/my/file', 'rb')
                body = bodies.Body(myfile, 42)
                return (200, 'OK', {}, body)

        The four HTTP body wrapper classes are now exposed as:

            ==========================  ==================================
            Exposed via                 Degu implementation
            ==========================  ==================================
            ``bodies.Body``             :class:`degu.base.Body`
            ``bodies.BodyIter``         :class:`degu.base.BodyIter`
            ``bodies.ChunkedBody``      :class:`degu.base.ChunkedBody`
            ``bodies.ChunkedBodyIter``  :class:`degu.base.ChunkedBodyIter`
            ==========================  ==================================

    *   The following four items have been dropped from the RGI *session*
        argument::

            session['rgi.version']  # eg, (0, 1)
            session['scheme']       # eg, 'https'
            session['protocol']     # eg, 'HTTP/1.1'
            session['server']       # eg, ('0.0.0.0', 12345)

        Although inspired by equivalent information in the WSGI *environ*, they
        don't seem particularly useful for the P2P REST API use case that Degu
        is focused on; in order to minimize the stable API commitments we're
        making for Degu 1.0, we're removing them for now, but we're open to
        adding any of them back post 1.0, assuming there is a good
        justification.


Other changes:

    *   Move ``_degu`` module to ``degu._base`` (the C extension)

    *   Rename ``degu.fallback`` module to ``degu._basepy`` (the pure-Python
        reference implementation)

    *   To keep memory usage flatter over time, :class:`degu.server.Server()`
        now unconditionally closes a connection after 5,000 requests have been
        handled; this is hard-coded in 0.9 but will be configurable in 1.0

    *   :class:`degu.base.Body()` now takes optional *iosize* kwarg; which
        defaults to :data:`degu.base.FILE_IO_BYTES`

    *   Add :meth:`degu.base.Body.write_to()` method to :class:`degu.base.Body`
        and its friends; this gives the HTTP body wrapper API greater
        composability, particularly useful should a Degu client or server use
        the *bodies* implementation from a other independent project


Performance improvements:

    *   The C implementation of :func:`degu.base.read_preamble()` is now around
        42% faster; this speed-up is thanks to decoding and case-folding the
        header keys in a single pass rather than using ``str.casefold()``, plus
        thanks to calling ``rfile.readline()`` using ``PyObject_Call()`` with
        pre-built argument tuples instead of ``PyObject_CallFunctionObjArgs()``
        with pre-built ``int`` objects

    *   :func:`degu.server.write_response()` is now around 8% faster, thanks to
        using a list comprehension for the headers, using a local variable for
        ``wfile.write``, and inlining the body writing

    *   Likewise, :func:`degu.client.write_request()` is also now around 8%
        faster, thanks to the same optimizations

    *   ``benchmark.py`` is now around 6% faster for ``AF_INET6`` and around 7%
        faster for ``AF_UNIX``

.. note::

    These benchmarks were done on an Intel® Core™ i5-4200M (2.5 GHz, dual-core,
    hyper-threaded) CPU running 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04.1, on AC power using the
    "performance" governor.

    To reproduce these results, you'll need to copy the ``benchmark.py`` and
    ``benchmark-parsing.py`` scripts from the Degu 0.9 source tree to the Degu
    0.8 source tree.



0.8 (August 2014)
-----------------

`Download Degu 0.8`_

Changes:

    * Add new :mod:`degu.rgi` module with :class:`degu.rgi.Validator` middleware
      for for verifying that servers, other middleware, and applications all
      comply with the :doc:`rgi` specification; this is a big step toward
      stabilizing both the RGI specification and the Degu API

    * Remove ``degu.server.Handler`` and ``degu.server.validate_response()``
      (unused since Degu 0.6)



0.7 (July 2014)
---------------

`Download Degu 0.7`_

Changes:

    * Rework :func:`degu.base.read_preamble()` to do header parsing itself; this
      combines the functionality of the previous ``read_preamble()`` function
      with the functionality of the now removed ``parse_headers()`` function
      (this is a breaking internal API change)

    * Add a C implementation of the new ``read_preamble()`` function, which
      provides around a 318% performance improvement over the pure-Python
      equivalent in Degu 0.6

    * The RGI server application used in the ``benchmark.py`` script now uses a
      static response body, which removes the noise from ``json.loads()``,
      ``json.dumps()``, and makes the ``benchmark.py`` results more consistent
      and more representative of true Degu performance

    * When using the new C version of ``read_preamble()``, ``benchmark.py`` is
      now around 20% faster for ``AF_INET6``, and around 26% faster for
      ``AF_UNIX`` (on an Intel® Core™ i7-4900MQ when using the *performance*
      governor); note that to verify this measurement, you need to copy the
      ``benchmark.py`` script from the Degu 0.7 tree back into the Degu 0.6 tree



0.6 (June 2014)
---------------

`Download Degu 0.6`_

Although Degu 0.6 brings a large number of breaking API changes, the high-level
server and client APIs are now (more or less) feature complete and can be (at
least cautiously) treated as API-stable; however, significant breakage and churn
should still be expected over the next few months in lower-level, internal, and
currently undocumented APIs.

Changes:

    * Consolidate previously scattered and undocumented RGI server application
      helper functions into the new :mod:`degu.util` module

    * Document some of the internal API functions in :mod:`degu.base` (note that
      none of these are API stable yet), plus document the new public IO
      abstraction classes:

        * :class:`degu.base.Body`

        * :class:`degu.base.BodyIter`

        * :class:`degu.base.ChunkedBody`

        * :class:`degu.base.ChunkedBodyIter`

    * As a result of the reworked IO abstraction classes (breaking change
      below), an incoming HTTP body can now be directly used as an outgoing HTTP
      body with no intermediate wrapper; this even further simplifies what it
      takes to implement an RGI reverse-proxy application

    * Degu and RGI now fully expose chunked transfer-encoding semantics,
      including the optional per-chunk extension; on both the input and output
      side of things, a chunk is now represented by a 2-tuple::

        (data, extension)

    * Largely rewrite the :doc:`rgi` specification to reflect the new
      connection-level semantics

    * Big update to the :doc:`tutorial` to cover request and response bodies,
      the IO abstraction classes, and chunked-encoding

    * Degu is now approximately 35% faster when it comes to writing an HTTP
      request or response preamble with 6 (or so) headers; the more headers, the
      bigger the performance improvement

    * Add ``./setup.py test --skip-slow`` option to skip the time-consuming (but
      important) live socket timeout tests... very handy for day-to-day
      development


Internal API changes:

    * ``read_lines_iter()`` has been replaced by
      :func:`degu.base.read_preamble()`

    * ``EmptyLineError`` has been renamed to :exc:`degu.base.EmptyPreambleError`

    * :func:`degu.base.read_chunk()` and :func:`degu.base.write_chunk()` now
      enforce a sane 16 MiB per-chunk data size limit

    * :func:`degu.base.read_preamble()` now allows up to 15 request or response
      headers (up from the previous 10 header limit)


Breaking public API changes:

    * If an RGI application object itself has an ``on_connect`` attribute, it
      must be a callable accepting two arguments (a *sock* and a *session*);
      when defined, ``app.on_connect()`` will be called whenever a new
      connection is recieved, before any requests have been handled for that
      connection; if ``app.on_connect()`` does not return ``True``, or if any
      unhandled exception occurs, the socket connection will be immediately
      shutdown without further processing; note that this is only a *breaking*
      API change if your application object happened to have an ``on_connect``
      attribute already used for some other purpose

    * RGI server applications now take two arguments when handling requests: a
      *session* and a *request*, both ``dict`` instances; the *request* argument
      now only contains strictly per-request information, whereas the
      server-wide and per-connection information has been moved into the new
      *session* argument

    * Replace previously separate input and output abstractions with new unified
      :class:`degu.base.Body` and :class:`degu.base.ChunkedBody` classes for
      wrapping file-like objects, plus :class:`degu.base.BodyIter` and
      :class:`degu.base.ChunkedBodyIter` classes for wrapping arbitrary iterable
      objects

    * As a result of the above two breaking changes, the names under which these
      wrappers classes are exposed to RGI applications have changed, plus
      they're now in the new RGI *session* argument instead of the existing
      *request* argument:

        ==================================  ==================================
        Exposed via                         Degu implementation
        ==================================  ==================================
        ``session['rgi.Body']``             :class:`degu.base.Body`
        ``session['rgi.BodyIter']``         :class:`degu.base.BodyIter`
        ``session['rgi.ChunkedBody']``      :class:`degu.base.ChunkedBody`
        ``session['rgi.ChunkedBodyIter']``  :class:`degu.base.ChunkedBodyIter`
        ==================================  ==================================

    * The previous ``make_input_from_output()`` function has been removed; there
      is no need for this now that you can directly use any HTTP input body as
      an HTTP output body (for, say, a reverse-proxy application)

    * Iterating through a chunk-encoded HTTP input body now yields a
      ``(data, extension)`` 2-tuple for each chunk; likewise,
      ``body.readchunk()`` now returns a ``(data, extension)`` 2-tuple; however,
      there has been no change in the behavior of ``body.read()`` on
      chunk-encoded bodies

    * Iterables used as the source for a chunk-encoded HTTP output body now must
      yield a ``(data, extension)`` 2-tuple for each chunk

In terms of the RGI request handling API, this is how you implemented a
*hello, world* RGI application in Degu 0.5 and earlier:

>>> def hello_world_app(request):
...     return (200, 'OK', {'content-length': 12}, b'hello, world')
...

As of Degu 0.6, it must now be implemented like this:

>>> def hello_world_app(session, request):
...     return (200, 'OK', {'content-length': 12}, b'hello, world')
...

Or here's a version that uses the connection-handling feature new in Degu 0.6:

>>> class HelloWorldApp:
... 
...     def __call__(self, session, request):
...         return (200, 'OK', {'content-length': 12}, b'hello, world')
... 
...     def on_connect(self, sock, session):
...         return True
... 

If the ``app.on_connect`` attribute exists, ``None`` is also a valid value.  If
needed, this allows you to entirely disable the connection handler in a
subclass.  For example:

>>> class HelloWorldAppSubclass(HelloWorldApp):
...     on_connect = None
... 

For more details, please see the :doc:`rgi` specification.



0.5 (May 2014)
--------------

`Download Degu 0.5`_

Changes:

    * Greatly expand and enhance documentation for the :mod:`degu.client` module

    * Modest update to the :mod:`degu.server` module documentation, in
      particular to cover HTTP over ``AF_UNIX``

    * Add a number of additional sanity and security checks in
      :func:`degu.client.build_client_sslctx()`, expand its unit tests
      accordingly

    * Likewise, add additional checks in
      :func:`degu.server.build_server_sslctx()`, expand its unit tests
      accordingly

    * :meth:`degu.client.Connection.close()` now only calls
      ``socket.socket.shutdown()``, which is more correct, and also eliminates
      annoying exceptions that could occur when a
      :class:`degu.client.Connection` (previously ``Client`` or ``SSLClient``)
      is garbage collected immediately prior to a script exiting

Breaking public API changes:

    * The ``Connection`` namedtuple has been replaced by the
      :class:`degu.client.Connection` class

    * ``Client.request()`` has been moved to
      :meth:`degu.client.Connection.request()`

    * ``Client.close()`` has been moved to
      :meth:`degu.client.Connection.close()`

Whereas previously you'd do something like this::

    from degu.client import Client
    client = Client(('127.0.0.1', 5984))
    client.request('GET', '/')
    client.close()

As of Degu 0.5, you now need to do this::

    from degu.client import Client
    client = Client(('127.0.0.1', 5984))
    conn = client.connect()
    conn.request('GET', '/')
    conn.close()

:class:`degu.client.Client` and :class:`degu.client.SSLClient` instances are
now stateless and thread-safe, do not themselves reference any socket resources.
On the other hand, :class:`degu.client.Connection` instances are stateful and
are *not* thread-safe.

Two things motivated these breaking API changes:

    * Justifiably, ``Client`` and ``SSLClient`` do rather thorough type and
      value checking on their constructor arguments; whereas previously you had
      to create a client instance per connection (eg, per thread), now you can
      create an arbitrary number of connections from a single client; this means
      that connections now are faster to create and have a lower per-connection
      memory footprint

    * In the near future, the Degu client API will support an  ``on_connect()``
      handler to allow 3rd party applications to do things like extended
      per-connection authentication; splitting the client creation out from the
      connection creation allows most 3rd party code to remain oblivious as to
      whether such an ``on_connect()`` handler is in use (as most code can
      merely create connections using the provided client, rather than
      themselves creating clients)
