        Create wordlists for `diceware`_::
        
          $ diceware-list -n -l 7776 /usr/share/dict/words
          11111 a
          11112 a's
          ...
          12353 capt
          12354 cara
          12355 carl
          ...
          66663 zoos
          66664 éclat
          66665 élan
          66666 épée
        
        This is not a `diceware`_ implementation, but only a helper to create
        appropriate wordlists.
        
        The main target of `diceware-list` is to provide "good"
        wordlists. Wordlists are considered "good" if they
        
        - contain enough terms for use with a certain diceware application
          (for instance 6^6 = 7776 terms if used with six six-sided dice)
        - contain terms as short as possible (to reduce typing)
        - (optionally) contain no words with non-ASCII chars (to enable use
          with non-localized keyboards)
        - (optionally) are a `prefix code`_, i.e. no complete word in the list is
          prefix of another word in the list.
        - contain no offending terms
        
        The last topic is hard to solve technically (hints welcome!), but
        `diceware-list` can help to follow the other design rules.
        
        The wordlists generated by `diceware-list` are not meant to be kept
        secret. You might put them on the internet, publish on facebook or
        print them in the New York Times. Instead the security of the
        `diceware`_ technique relies on the entropy or (in this case)
        "randomness" of your dice, computer, etc.
        
        In other words: Your passphrases will not be safe because of hiding
        your wordlist. They will be safe because there are so many possible
        combinations of words you can pick from your wordlist. That means:
        longer lists are more secure than shorter ones (if really used to full
        extent by your source of randomness with `diceware`_), but hidden
        lists are *not* more secure than public ones.
        
        
        Install
        --------
        
        Install latest release from pypi_ ::
        
          (venv) $ pip install diceware-list
        
        or clone repository from github::
        
          $ git clone https://github.com/ulif/diceware-list.git
        
        Please consider using `virtualenv`_ for deployment.
        
        In an active virtualenv you can install an executable script of
        `diceware-list` running::
        
          (venv) $ python setup.py install
          (venv) $ diceware-list --help
          usage: diceware-list [-h] [-l LENGTH] [-n] [--ascii] [-d SIDES] [-k]
                               [--use-416] [-p {none,short,long}] [-v] [--version]
                               DICTFILE [DICTFILE ...]
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        First, you need a file with words as "dictionary". On typical Debian
        systems such files can be found in ``/usr/share/dicts/``.
        
        This file can then be fed to `diceware-list` to create a wordlist
        suitable for use with diceware.::
        
          $ diceware-list /usr/share/dict/words
          !
          !!
          !!!
          ...
          alan
          alana
          alar
          ...
          zzz
          zzzz
        
        By default lists of 8192 (=2**13) words are created. This value can be
        changed with the `-l` option.
        
        With `-n` you can tell `diceware-list` to put numbers into each line,
        representing dice throws [#]_ ::
        
        
          $ diceware_list -n -l 7776 /usr/share/dict/words
          11111 !
          11112 !!
          ...
          12353 alan
          12354 alana
          12355 alar
          ...
          66665 zzz
          66666 zzzz
        
        The `--ascii` option filters terms out, that contain non-ASCII
        characters. This can help in generating non-english word lists that
        are usable with regular english keyboards.
        
        The verbose option `--verbose` can be given multiple times to increase
        verbosity.
        
        See `--help` for other options.
        
        `diceware-list` follows loosely the recommendations given on
        http://diceware.com/ by Mr. Reinhold.
        
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        In a clone of the sources you can run tests like this::
        
          (venv) $ python setup.py test
        
        This command will download all required packages, especially
        `py.test`_.
        
        You can also install `py.test`_ manually with `pip`_::
        
          (venv)$ pip install pytest
          (venv)$ pip install -e .
        
        and afterwards run tests like so::
        
          (venv)$ py.test
        
        If you also install `tox`::
        
          (venv)$ pip install tox
        
        then you can run all tests for all supported platforms at once::
        
          (venv)$ tox
        
        
        Coverage
        --------
        
        To get a coverage report, you can use the respective `tox` target::
        
          (venv)$ tox -e cov
        
        Or you use the common `coverage` tool::
        
          (venv)$ pip install coverage
          (venv)$ coverage run setup.py test
          (venv)$ coverage report --include="diceware_list.py,libwordlist.py"
        
        
        .. [#] The wordlist length in this case should be
               ``(number-of-sides-per-dice)`` powered to
               ``(number-of-dicethrows)``, for instance 6**5 = 7776 for five
               six-sided dice or a single six-sided dice thrown five times.

        Changes
        *******
        
        
        1.0 (2017-02-09)
        ================
        
        - The ``dicewarekit.txt`` list is not included in generated lists by
          default from now on. You can request inclusion with new option
          `use-kit`.  The old option `no-kit` is not supported any more.
        
        - In numbered output, separate digits by ``-`` to distinguish numbers
          with more than one digit. Needed at least when generating wordlists
          for dice with more than 9 sides.
        
        - Rename `-s` option to `-d` (as in ``dice-sides``).
        
        - Logging output now registered under name `libwordlist`.
        
        - Added new module `libwordlist` containing the API parts of `diceware-list`.
        
        - New `--version` option.
        
        - New `--prefix` option. If set prefix code is generated, i.e. lists that
          contain no item which is prefix of another list item.
        
        - Claim support for Python 3.6.
        
        - Restructure package: all single scripts are now part of a package.
        
        
        0.3 (2016-07-25)
        ================
        
        - Install script as `diceware-list` instead of `diceware_list`.
        
        - Allow `--sides` option to support dice that do not have six sides.
        
        
        0.2 (2016-03-18)
        ================
        
        - Allow `-v` option multiple times for increased verbosity.
        
        - Pick maximum width terms randomly. Until that change we included all
          shorter entries and additionally the (alphabetically) first entries
          of maximum width. Now, we pick a random set of these maximum width
          entries for the result list.
        
        - Claim support for Python 3.5.
        
        
        0.1 (2016-02-09)
        ================
        
        - Initial release.
