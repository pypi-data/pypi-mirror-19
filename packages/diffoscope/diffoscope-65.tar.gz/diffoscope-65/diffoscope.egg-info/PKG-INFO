Description: diffoscope
        ==========
        
        diffoscope will try to get to the bottom of what makes files or
        directories different. It will recursively unpack archives of many kinds
        and transform various binary formats into more human readable form to
        compare them. It can compare two tarballs, ISO images, or PDF just as
        easily.
        
        It can be scripted through error codes, and a report can be produced
        with the detected differences. The report can be text or HTML.
        When no type of report has been selected, diffoscope defaults
        to write a text report on the standard output.
        
        diffoscope is developed as part of the `“reproducible builds” Debian
        project <https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds>`_.
        It is meant to be able to quickly understand why two builds of the same
        package produce different outputs. diffoscope was previously named
        debbindiff.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        To compare two files in-depth and produce an HTML report, run something like::
        
            $ bin/diffoscope --html output.html build1.changes build2.changes
        
        diffoscope will exit with 0 if there's no differences and 1 if there
        are.
        
        *diffoscope* can also compare non-existent files::
        
            $ bin/diffoscope /nonexistent archive.zip
        
        To get all possible options, run::
        
            $ bin/diffoscope --help
        
        External dependencies
        ---------------------
        
        diffoscope requires Python 3 and the following modules available on PyPI:
        `libarchive-c <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libarchive-c>`_,
        `python-magic <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-magic>`_.
        
        Optionally, the following modules will enhance it:
        
        * ``tlsh`` is used to recognize file renames.
          It is build from `tlsh source
          <https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh>`_.
          Available on Debian as ``python3-tlsh``.
        * ``python-debian`` is used to inspect Debian control files.
          It is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-debian>`_.
        * ``rpm-python`` is used to inspect RPM files.
          It is built from `rpm
          <http://rpm.org/>`_.
          Available on Debian and Fedora as ``python3-rpm``.
        * ``Magic-file-extension`` can be used instead of
          ``python-magic``. It is built from `file
          <https://www.darwinsys.com/file/>`_.
          Available on Debian and Fedora as ``python3-magic``.
        * ``argcomplete`` is used for argument completion.
          Available on Debian as ``python3-argcomplete``.
          Available on Fedora as ``python-argcomplete``.
          Available on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argcomplete/>`
        
        The various comparators rely on external commands being available. To
        get a list of them, please run::
        
            $ bin/diffoscope --list-tools
