diskutil_parser
===============
Gathers information about the disks present on a `macOS` installation by reading the output of `diskutil`.

Currently supported:

- Partition scheme information

- Mount point

- Partitions

  - Partition information

If there's any feature you don't see, make an issue.
I only wrote what I needed, but I'm sure many other features are easy to add.
