Description: 
        As more and more apps are using maps, the more demand for geolocation capabilities increase.
        Geolocation is about the reporting of your location to other users,
        as well as associating real-world locations (such as landmarks) to your location.
        This repo helps to accurately calculate the distance between two locations
        and presents a time efficient practical solution,
        that is almost 3 times faster than similar fast pure python implementation.
