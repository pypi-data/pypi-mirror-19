Description: distributed-chat
        ================
        
        This program will implement distributed chat on virtual ring topology
        network. Furthermore this program will implement Chang-Roberts algorithm
        to achieve full ordering of messages.
        
        Features: - Nodes can freely join into existing ring, based on
        information about one node (IP:port). First node will join with itself
        into ring. - Ring will recover from unexpected disconnect of one node at
        the time. - One node will be elected as central authority (leader), all
        messages will be then passed through leader. - Leader will be elected
        using Chang-Roberts algorithm. - GUI in Qt, it will also have CLI. -
        Encryption of messages.
        
        How to build documentation
        --------------------------
        
        1. Create virtual environment using: ``python3.5 -m venv env``
        2. Activate virtual environment: ``. env/bin/activate``
        3. Install dependencies: ``python -m pip install -r requirements.txt``
        4. Change directory into docs: ``cd docs``
        5. Build documentation: ``make html``
        6. Open file ``docs/_build/html/index.html`` to view documentation.
        
        How to run tests
        ----------------
        
        Run (in installed and activated virtual environment):
        
        ``python setup.py test``
        
        or
        
        ``pytest -v tests/test_chat.py``
