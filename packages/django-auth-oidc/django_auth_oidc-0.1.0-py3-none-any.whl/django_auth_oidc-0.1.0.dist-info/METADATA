Django-Auth-OIDC - OpenID Connect authentication support for Django
=========================================================================
.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/django-auth-oidc.svg
    :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/django-auth-oidc

This is a Django login view that authenticates against an OpenID Connect
Authentication Server.

Use it if you own a single Authentication Server that you want to share
between multiple apps.

What is OpenID Connect?
-----------------------

It's a OAuth2-based standard for authentication in applications.

It can be used for social logins (but python-social-auth_ is much better
for this case), and for setting up Single Sign-On into multiple services
hosted by the same company. In the last case, it somewhat supersedes LDAP,
as with OIDC people are entering their credentials only into the views
served by the Authentication Server, and not into all the company's
applications.

------------

- Python 3.6+. **Python 2 is not supported, and wonâ€™t ever get supported.**
