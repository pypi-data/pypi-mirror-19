 :alt: Django AutoTest

Description
===========

Provides the 'autotest' command which enhances django's built in test feature
with the auto reload feature used in django's runserver command.

Installation
============

Install via pip or your python egg layer of choice:

pip install django-autotest-command

Then add to your django settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = (
...
'autotest',
)

No other apps are required except for django core.

Usage
=====

Run like a usual django test:

./manage.py autotest [app_name[.tests.TestCaseName[.test_name]]]

This testing tool will launch the test suite, setup the database and then run
the test suite as usual. When finished it will wait for a file to change
in your project before re-running the tests.

When re-running it will by default only test the previous failures on the next
run through. If all tests passed, then it will run all tests.

After failures are detected, they are all listed by number. You can select one
or more tests to target by typing the numbers seperated by commas and hitting
enter. Targeting allows you to focus on one bug at a time.

When finished with your test targeting press enter at the prompt to reset.

Coverage
========

Coverage reports can be generated by install the coverage module >=4.0.0 and
will pick up on any .coveragerc file in your project. A new report will only
run when all items are being tested. Partial coverage reports are not yet
supported.

Base Test Classes
=================

autotest.base contains useful base classes which can help you write tests for django.
The functionality includes getObj for getting objects of a certain type. assertGet/Post
for making requests with status checking and forum error checking. As well as client
and user management functions.
