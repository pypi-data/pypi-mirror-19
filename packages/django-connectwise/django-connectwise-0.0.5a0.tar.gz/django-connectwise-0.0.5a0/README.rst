Documentation

TODO

-  Add to INSTALLED_APPS
-  Available settings
-  Use standard Django model signals to see when this apps objects change
-  Uses easy-thumbnails- can use settings from that project to change
   behaviour http://easy-thumbnails.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ref/settings/. Also
   must add to INSTALLED\_APPS (I think)
