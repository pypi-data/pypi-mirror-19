Introduction
============

A collection of Django apps for copying things from third-party sites and services. This is still in-progress and things may change. Requires Python 3.4 or 3.5, and Django 1.8 or 1.9.

Currently, Ditto can copy these things from these services:

- `Flickr <https://flickr.com/>`_
    - Photos
    - Photosets
    - Original image and video files
    - Users
- `Pinboard <https://pinboard.in/>`_
    - Bookmarks
- `Twitter <https://twitter.com/>`_
    - Tweets
    - Favorites/Likes
    - Images and Animated GIFs (but not videos)
    - Users

It can save these things for one or more account on each service. See possible future services, and overall progress, in `this issue <https://github.com/philgyford/django-ditto/issues/23>`_.

Public and private Photos, Bookmarks and Tweets are saved, but only public ones are displayed in the included Django views and templates; non-public ones are only visible in the Django admin.

The Ditto app provides:

- Models
- Admin
- Management commands to fetch the data/files
- Views and URLs
- Templates (that use `Bootstrap 4 <http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com>`_)
- Template tags for common things (eg, most recent Tweets, or Flickr photos uploaded on a particular day)
