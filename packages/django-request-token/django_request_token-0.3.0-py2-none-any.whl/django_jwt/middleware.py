        If a token is found (using JWT_QUERYSTRING_ARG), then it is decoded,
        which verifies the signature and expiry dates, and raises a 403 if
        the token is invalid.

        The decoded payload is then added to the request as the `token_payload`
        property - allowing it to be interrogated by the view function
        decorator when it gets there.

        We don't substitute in the user at this point, as we are not making
        any assumptions about the request path at this point - it's not until
        we get to the view function that we know where we are heading - at
        which point we verify that the scope matches, and only then do we
        use the token user.
