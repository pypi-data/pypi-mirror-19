        -------------------
        
        Add static files never was so easy. This library allows you to include css, js and images files (static files) on a template faster than the old way.
        
        
        Install
        -------
        
        ```pip install django-staticimport```
        
        or
        
        ```easy_install django-staticimport```
        
        
        Usage.
        ------
        
        ####Add the app to settings.
        
        ```python
        # installing the static_import application.
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
        		.
        		.
        		.
        
            'static_import',
        ]
        
        # adding remote static file.
        HOSTED_LIBS = [
        	{
        		'name': 'selectjs',
        		'url': 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/select2/4.0.3/js/select2.min.js'
        	},
        ]
        ```
        
        ####Then.. on the templates.
        
        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        {% load staticimport %}
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
        	<meta charset="UTF-8">
        	<title>Hi</title>
        	<!-- including css files -->
        	{% import 'main.css' %}
        	{% import 'something.css' %}
        	
        	<!-- including js files with custom attributes -->
        	{% import 'angularjs' %}
        	{% import 'main.js' attrs='async' %}
        </head>
        <body>
        	<!-- including images -->
        	{% import 'image.jpg' css='image' id='image' attrs='width="100px" height="100px" data-city="picture"' %}
        	<h1>hello world</h1>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```
        
        ####also you could downlaod static files with new django command, called
        ```python manage.py download_static_file angularjs https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/1140/2.0/1140.min.css```
