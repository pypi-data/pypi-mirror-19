Application that improves and speeds up web development process using Docker.

|

=========
**Setup**
=========

|

**docker-console package installation**
=======================================

Requirements for docker-console:

* python-pip package::

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install python-pip

|

* docker
* docker-compose


When this requirements are satisfied, you can install docker-console through pip using command::

    sudo pip install docker-console

|

All other dependencies will be automatically installed during docker-console installation process.

|


**docker-console package update**
=================================
To update docker-console package, you need to run the same command as for installation with additional option **--upgrade**::

    sudo pip install docker-console --upgrade

|

**Autocomplete activation**
===========================

During package installation, bash completion scripts are placed in::

    /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/docker-console

|

To activate docker-console commands and options completion, you need to logout and login again, or type::

    exec bash

without logging out.

|
|

==================================
**Available commands and options**
==================================

|

**Commands that can be run from anywhere**
==========================================

- default:
    Default action if no command spefified. This command is equivalent to::

        docker-console

    and::

        docker-console help

|

- help:
    Print available options, aliases AND commands including commands added locally for project in dc_overrides.py (if you are running this command in project wrapper).
    If you use --help option, you will not see available commands, but you can always use::

        docker-console <tab><tab>

    to see this available commands. Note that autocomplete mechanism is not working for commands added locally for project in dc_overrides.py.

    |

    This command is equivalent to::

        docker-console

    and::

        docker-console default

|

- init:
    This command is copying following files from docker-console default templates to project wrapper:
        - docker-compose.yml,
        - docker-compose-jenkins.yml,
        - docker/my.conf,
        - docker_console/dc_overrides.py,
        - docker_console/dc_settings.py

    Files existing in project wrapper localization, by default will not be replaced.

    |

    Options:

    \-f, \--force-replace-conf
        Set if you want force replace your existing config files listed above.
        All your changes in listed files will be irrevocably lost. Other files in wrapper folder and 'docker' folder will stay unchanged.

|

- cleanup:
    | This command is running three commands that are cleaning up unneeded docker containers, images and volumes.
    | See http://blog.yohanliyanage.com/2015/05/docker-clean-up-after-yourself/ for precise description.

|

- refresh-autocomplete:
    Recreates bash completion script. It can be used if you want add support for autocomplete of newly added project aliases, or new custom project commands.
    After that command you need to logout and login again, or run::

        exec bash

    command to apply autocomplete changes.

|

**Commands that needs to be run from project wrapper with docker-compose.yml file**
===================================================================================

- shell:
    Print docker command that runs shell inside docker.

    |

    Options:

    \-c, \--docker-container
        Set container name to run bash in it.

    |

    \-s, \--docker-shell-run

|

- up:
    Start all containers defined in docker-compose.yml

    |

    This command is equivalent to::

        docker-console start

|

- start:
    Start all containers defined in docker-compose.yml

    |

    This command is equivalent to::

        docker-console up

|

- stop:
    Stops all containers that were started for current project.

|

- restart:
    This command is equivalent to following two commands running one after another in order such as below::

        1. docker-console stop
        2. docker-console start/up

|

- drush:
    Allows for running any drush command inside docker.

|
|

=============================
**Usage with Drupal project**
=============================

|

**docker-console initialization in drupal project**
===================================================

To initialize docker-console in drupal project you can either manually create following files:

- docker-compose.yml,
- docker_console/dc_overrides.py,
- docker_console/dc_settings.py

|

, or run::

    docker-console init

command. This command will copy this files and some other additional files:

- docker-compose-jenkins.yml,
- docker/my.conf,

|

from default package templates to your project wrapper. If you are creating **docker_console/dc_settings.py** file manually,
you should **look at the source of docker_console package conf/default.py** file to see what config options are available and what are default values.

After that, you should adjust settings for your project in::

    <project_name>/docker_console/dc_settings.py

file if needed.


|

**Adding config entry for project to /etc/hosts**
=================================================

To add config entry for project to /etc/hosts you need to run::

    docker-console add-host-to-etc-hosts

This command will run docker for current project and add entry to /etc/hosts with IP Address taken from web container
and hosts names taken from VIRTUAL_HOST variable for web and phpmyadmin containers configuration in docker-compose.yml

|

**Adding Project Aliases**
==========================

docker-console application allows for defining project aliases like in drush. In alias configuration there is only project wrapper path configuration. This path should be absolute.

|

Alias files have to be placed in::

    ~/.docker_console/aliases/

folder. This folder is automatically created during installation. You can place here as many aliases files as you need, with any number of aliases in each file.

|

Example alias.py file::

    project_1_alias = {
        'path': '/path/to/project1/wrapper/'
    }

    project_2_alias = {
        'path': '/path/to/project2/wrapper/'
    }

    __all__ = ['project_1_alias', 'project_2_alias']

|

If you will create alias for project you will be able to run docker-console from anywhere with project path given in alias::

    docker-console @project_1_alias

|

After adding new aliases, you need to run::

    docker-console refresh-autocomplete

to add autocomplete support for new aliases.


|

**Adjusting default, global configuration options, classes methods and commands to specific project needs, using custom overriding files**
==========================================================================================================================================

|

**Adjusting configuration options**
-----------------------------------

To adjust configuration options you need to modify::

    <project_name>/docker_console/dc_settings.py

file.

|

You can either modify default options values or add new options.

|

Example dc_settings.py file for drupal7 web engine::

    # import default values from drupal7 engine (required)
    from docker_console.web.engines.drupal7.conf.default import *

    #################
    # BASE SETTINGS #
    #################

    WEB = {
        'ENGINE': 'drupal7',
        'USE_CUSTOM_ENGINE': False, # True/False - useful when we have default and custom engine with the same name
        'APP_LOCATION': 'app',
        'APP_CONF_LOCATION': 'app_conf',
        'APP_DATA_LOCATION': 'app_data',
        'TMP_PATH': '/tmp'
    }

    DB = {
        'default': {
            'DRIVER': 'mysql',
            'HOST': 'mysql',
            'NAME': 'db',
            'USER': 'user',
            'PASS': 'pass',
            'ROOT_USER': 'root',
            'ROOT_PASS': '123',
            'DUMP_IMPORT_FILE': 'app_databases/database.sql.tar.gz',
            'DUMP_EXPORT_LOCATION': 'app_databases/',
        }
    }

    TESTS = {
        'IMAGES': {
            'selenium_image': ('selenium/standalone-chrome', None),
            'codecept_image': ('droptica/codecept', None)
        },
        'LOCATION': "tests"
    }

    ENV = None

    ####################
    # DRUPAL7 SETTINGS #
    ####################

    DEV_DOCKER_IMAGES = {
        'default': ('droptica/drupal-dev', None),
        'additional_images': [
    #     ('vendor/image_name', None), # image from dockerhub
    #     ('vendor/image_name', 'path_to_dockerfile') # custom image from Dockerfile
        ]
    }

    DRUPAL = {
        'default': {
            'ADMIN_USER': 'admin',
            'ADMIN_PASS': '123',
            'SITE_URI': 'default.dev',
            'SITE_DIRECTORY': 'default',
            'FILES_DST': 'sites/default/',
            'PRIVATE_FILES_DST': 'sites/default/files/',
            'FILES_ARCHIVE': 'app_files/files.tar.gz',
            'PRIVATE_FILES_ARCHIVE': 'app_files/private.tar.gz',
            'SETTINGS_TEMPLATE_SUBDIR': None,
            'STAGE_FILE_PROXY_URL': None
        }
    }

|

**Adjusting classes methods and commands**
------------------------------------------

To adjust classes methods or commands you need to modify::

    <project_name>/docker_console/dc_overrides.py

file.

You can either replace existing classes methods or add new methods. Methods from classes can be used create new or replace existing commands locally in project context.

Example dc_overrides.py file::


    # import classes to override
    from docker_console.web.engines.drupal7.drush import Drush
    from docker_console.web.engines.drupal7.builder import Builder

    # add new methods
    class DrushLocal:
        def localtest(self, text):
            print text

    Drush.__bases__ += (DrushLocal,)

    class BuilderLocal:
        def printlocal(self):
            self.drush.localtest('printlocal')

    Builder.__bases__ += (BuilderLocal,)

    # override existing method
    def drush_uli_local(self):
        print self.config.DRUPAL[self.config.drupal_site]['ADMIN_USER']

    Drush.uli = drush_uli_local


    # replace/add new commands
    commands_overrides = {
        'localtest': [
            'confirm_action',
            'drush.localtest("upwd %s --password=123" % self.config.DRUPAL[self.config.drupal_site]["ADMIN_USER"])'
        ],
        'drush_uli': [
            'confirm_action("no")',
            'drush.uli'
        ],
    }
