    This class provides you all relevant information about the cause-

    ``summary`` suffices in most cases, ``attain_effects`` and
    ``attain_causes`` tell you which causes are required for the

    values up to (including) to attain the given share of effects
    or causes.

        effect_values (List[number]): An iterable of effect values.

          in fractional notation.
        summary_decimal (dict): Tells you which causes provoke which
          effects in decimal notation.
        ratio (float): entropy of ``effect_values`` in proportion
          to ``control_limit``. If less or equal than one, a
          pareto distribution is present.
        pareto (bool): True if a pareto distribution is present.
