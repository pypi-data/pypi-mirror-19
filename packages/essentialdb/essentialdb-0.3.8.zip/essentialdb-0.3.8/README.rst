
A Fast Embedded Database in Python.

Use case: You want to prototype an idea wihtout a heavyweight database install. If the idea works out though, you don't want
to rewrite all of your data access code.

EssentialDB helps solve that problem by being (nearly) api compatible with MongoDB. That way when your idea starts to grow,
you can switch to MongoDB to scale.

* Syntax and semantics are very similar to MongoDB, lowering the barrier of entry.
* Fairly complex query support.
* Its in pure python.
* Its very fast.
