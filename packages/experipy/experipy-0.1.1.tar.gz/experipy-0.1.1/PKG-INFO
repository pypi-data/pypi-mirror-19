Description: ==========
         Experipy
        ==========
        
        A framework for writing and running Computational Science experiments.
        
        Experipy provides a composable grammar for automatically writing scripts and a tool which can then execute them. Support for PBS script based queueing is (mostly) implemented.
        
        ------------------
         A Simple Example
        ------------------
        
        ::
        
            from experipy.exp       import Experiment
            from experipy.grammar   import Executable
        
            exp = Experiment(Executable("echo", ["Hello World"]), 
                             expname="test", 
                             destdir="results")
            exp.run()
        
        This will run the program ``echo`` with the argument ``Hello World`` in a directory in ``/tmp``, writing the output and error, along with timing information, to the directory ``results``. Directories will be created as needed. A complete example showing how to write an experiment for a Python script can be found in ``test/runtest.py``.
        
        ------------
         Components
        ------------
        
            experipy.grammar
                Contains abstractions for describing program executables, their argurments, and relationships between them such as pipelines. 
        
            experipy.system
                Contains a number of standard tools such as ``cp``, ``mkdir``, and the Python interpreter described as elements within the grammar.
        
            experipy.exp
                Contains the Experiment class, instances of which accepts a composition in the grammar, and can generate and execute a shell script from it.
        
            corsys
                Tools used by the Corsys research group at UTK, will likely be separated at some point, but serves as a useful example (Heavily WIP)
        
        -----------------------
         Features In The Works
        -----------------------
        
        - Develop a means for defining configurations
        
        - Expand ``experipy.system`` to include more standard command line tools
        
        - Beef up PBS script options
