        Registrations
        =============
        
        Registrations is a Django app that allows users to register using
        email or mobile phone (SMS), then sends out a verification code
        via that method for the user to use when confirming their account
        to activate their account.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "registrations" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'registrations',
            )
        
        2. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the registrations models.
