PyFinTS
=======

This is a pure-python implementation of FinTS (formerly known as HBCI), a
online-banking protocol commonly supported by German banks.

Limitations
-----------

* Only FinTS 3.0 is supported
* Only PIN/TAN authentication is supported, no signature cards
* Only a number of reading operations are currently supported

Banks tested:

* GLS Bank eG
* Triodos Bank
* BBBank eG
* Postbank

Usage
-----

    import logging
    from fints3.client import FinTS3PinTanClient

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    f = FinTS3PinTanClient(
        '123456789',  # Your bank's BLZ
        'myusername',
        'mypin',
        'https://mybank.com/â€¦'  # endpoint, e.g.: https://hbci-pintan.gad.de/cgi-bin/hbciservlet
    )

    accounts = f.get_sepa_accounts()
    print(accounts)
    # [SEPAAccount(iban='DE12345678901234567890', bic='ABCDEFGH1DEF', accountnumber='123456790', subaccount='',
    #              blz='123456789')]

    statement = f.get_statement(accounts[0], date(2016, 12, 1), date.today())
    print([t.data for t in statement])
    # The statement is a list of transaction objects as parsed by the mt940 parser, see
    # https://mt940.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mt940.html#mt940.models.Transaction
    # for documentation. Most information is contained in a dict accessible via their
    # ``data`` property
