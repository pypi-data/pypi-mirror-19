Description: ==========
        flake8-pyi
        ==========
        
        A plugin for Flake8 that provides specializations for
        `type hinting stub files <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#stub-files>`_,
        especially interesting for linting
        `typeshed <https://github.com/python/typeshed/>`_.
        
        
        Functionality
        -------------
        
        1. Adds the ``.pyi`` extension to the default value of the ``--filename``
           command-line argument to Flake8.  This means stubs are linted by default with
           this plugin enabled, without needing to explicitly list every file.
        
        2. Modifies PyFlakes runs for ``.pyi`` files to defer checking type annotation
           expressions after the entire file has been read.  This enables support for
           first-class forward references that stub files use.
        
        The latter should ideally be merged into ``flake8`` as the integration is
        currently pretty brittle (might break with future versions of ``pyflakes``,
        ``flake8``, or due to interactions with other overly clever plugins).
        
        
        List of warnings
        ----------------
        
        Currently this plugin doesn't add any warnings of its own.  It does reserve
        codes starting with **Y0**.
