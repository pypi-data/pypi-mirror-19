        Magically create Swagger_ documentation as you magically create your RESTful API with Flask-Restless_
        
        This has lingered a while without the love it needs due to other more pressing projects.  Contributions are welcome and appreciated.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        This strives to be a drop in replacement for Flask-Restless_' APIManager.  It wraps 
        the APIManager calls to try to gather enough information to present a Swagger_ 2.0
        file.  It also deploys the static content for the Swagger-UI configured to point
        to said Swagger_ JSON file.
        
        Status
        ------
        Currently it "works-for-me".  There are a few terrible assumptions it makes.  It 
        probably needs some more features to be usable for everyone.  Suggestions, and 
        pull requests are welcome.
        
        TODO

        * Add Docstrings in Models as descriptions
        * Cleanup Markup
        * Make it suck less
