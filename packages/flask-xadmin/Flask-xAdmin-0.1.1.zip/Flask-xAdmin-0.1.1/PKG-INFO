Description: Flask-xAdmin
        ============
        
        Flask-xAdmin is an ***extended*** Flask-Admin extension for admin apps, standing on the shoulders of giants: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Security and Flask-Admin. 
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Flask-xAdmin is a ***extended*** *life batteries-included*, simple-to-use `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ extension that lets you
        add admin interfaces to Flask applications. 
        
        The goal of Flask-xAdmin is to give additional flexibility to Flask-Admin apps and to make admin developer job easier.  
        
        *Extended life* means that apps built with Flask-xAdmin are smaller and more resistant to database model changes, thus providing admin app extended lifetime & flexibility (between changes).
        
        Flask-xAdmin specific features are tested on  `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_. 
        
        Flask-xAdmin is a new project.

        Several usage examples are included in the */examples* folder. Please feel free to add your own examples, or improve
        on some of the existing ones, and then submit them via GitHub as a *pull-request*.

        The docs are auto-generated from the *.rst* files in the */doc* folder. So if you come across any errors, or
