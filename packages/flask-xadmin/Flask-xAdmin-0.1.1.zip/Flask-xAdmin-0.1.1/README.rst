Flask-xAdmin
============

Flask-xAdmin is an ***extended*** Flask-Admin extension for admin apps, standing on the shoulders of giants: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Security and Flask-Admin. 

Introduction
------------

Flask-xAdmin is a ***extended*** *life batteries-included*, simple-to-use `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ extension that lets you
add admin interfaces to Flask applications. 

The goal of Flask-xAdmin is to give additional flexibility to Flask-Admin apps and to make admin developer job easier.  

*Extended life* means that apps built with Flask-xAdmin are smaller and more resistant to database model changes, thus providing admin app extended lifetime & flexibility (between changes).

Flask-xAdmin specific features are tested on  `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_. 

Flask-xAdmin is a new project.
