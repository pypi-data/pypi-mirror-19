flufl.enum
==========

A Python enumeration package.

The `flufl.enum` library is a Python enumeration package.  Its goal is to
provide simple, specific, concise semantics in an easy to read and write
syntax.  `flufl.enum` has just enough of the features needed to make
enumerations useful, but without a lot of extra baggage to weigh them down.
This work grew out of the Mailman 3.0 project.

**Note: This package is deprecated!** Python 3.4 added an enum package to its
`standard library`_ which is also available as a `third party package`_ on
PyPI for older versions of Python.  If you are using `flufl.enum` you should
switch to the standard enum package.
