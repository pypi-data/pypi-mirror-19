        This little utility is a wrapper on great FS-UAE_ emulator, to perform some
        actions, like uncompressing archived files (CD ROMs images, filesystems),
        launch the emulator and archive emulator save state.
        
        As an example, if there is a collection of CD³² game files and one want to
        provide configuration for each game, but want to keep ISO images with
        corresponding files in archive (due to size of those images) than FS-UAE
        Wrapper is a way to achieve this.
        
        The reason behind writing this wrapper is a need for having a portable set of
        games/systems where there would be a way for storing the state of either entire
        filesystem or just console state (in case of CD³²) and keeping size small,
        preferably in a archive file vs a bunch of files.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        - Python (2 or 3)
        - `fs-uae`_ (obviously :)
        
        Also, there should be archivers programs available for compress/decompress
        archives. Fs-uae-wrapper supports several types of archives:
        
        - `7z`_
        - `lha`_
        - `lzx`_ - decompress only
        - `rar`_ - if only ``unrar`` is available, than only decompression is supported
        - `tar`_, also compressed with:
        
          - bzip2
          - gzip
          - xz
        
        - `zip`_
        
        There are several archive types which are supported, ranging from tar
        (compressed with gzip, bzip2 and xz), 7z, rar, zip. lha and lzx. All of those
        formats should have corresponding decompressors available in the system,
        otherwise archive extraction will fail.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Just perform (preferably in ``virtualenv``) a command:
        
        .. code:: shell-session
        
           $ pip install fs-uae-wrapper
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        After installation you should be able to access new command
        ``fs-uae-wrapper``, and its invocation is identical like ``fs-uae`` binary:
        
        .. code:: shell-session
        
           $ fs-uae-wrapper [fs-uae-config-file] [parameters]
        
        There is special option for passing wrapping module, which might be placed
        directly in fs-uae configuration or passed as an option:
        
        .. code:: ini
        
           [config]
           ...
           wrapper = cd32
           ...
        
        or
        
        .. code:: shell-session
        
           $ fs-uae-wrapper --wrapper=cd32
        
        In this case there would several things happen. First, ``Config.fs-uae`` would
        be searched, read and there would be ``wrapper`` option searched. If found,
        specific module will be loaded and depending on the module, there would be
        performed specific tasks before ``fs-uae`` is launched and after it.
        
        Assumption is, that configuration file are written in portable way, so the are
        saved as `relative configuration file`_ (hence the name ``Config.fs-uae``, even
        if the are named differently. If certain wrapper is specified, it will create
        temporary directory and place the configuration file there as
        ``Config.fs-uae``.
        
        If no ``wrapper`` option would be passed either as an config option or
        command line argument, all command line options will be passed to the fs-uae
        executable as-is.
        
        Modules
        =======
        
        Currently, three wrapper modules are available:
        
        - plain
        - cd32
        - archive
        
        plain
        -----
        
        Options used:
        
        * None
        
        ``Plain`` module is kind of dummy or failsafe if you will, since all it do is
        run ``fs-uae`` with provided configuration and command line options. It will be
        chosen in case when there is no ``wrapper`` option provided neither via the
        configuration file nor command line parameter.
        
        cd32
        ----
        
        Options used:
        
        * ``wrapper`` (required) with ``cd32`` as an value
        * ``wrapper_archive`` (required) path to the archive with CD32 iso/cue/wav
        * ``wrapper_gui_msg`` (optional) if set to "1", will display a graphical
          message during extracting files
        
        Let's see some sample config for a game, which is saved as
        ``ChaosEngine.fs-uae``:
        
        .. code:: ini
           :number-lines:
        
           [config]
           wrapper = cd32
           wrapper_archive = ChaosEngine.7z
           wrapper_gui_msg = 1
        
           amiga_model = CD32
           title = The Chaos Engine CD32
        
           cdrom_drive_0 = Chaos Engine, The (1994)(Renegade)(M4)[!][CDD3445].cue
        
           save_states_dir = $CONFIG/fs-uae-save/
        
           joystick_port_1_mode = cd32 gamepad
           platform = cd32
        
        Next, the invocation of the wrapper would be as follows:
        
        .. code:: shell-session
        
           $ fs-uae-wrapper ChaosEngine.fs-uae
        
        Now, there several thing will happen:
        
        - Config file will be read, and wrapper module will be find (because we already
          put it on line 2)
        - New temporary directory will be created
        - Archive with game assists will be extracted in that directory
        - Configuration file will be copied into that directory, and renamed to
          ``Config.fs-uae``
        - If there is saved state, it also would be extracted there
        - ``fs-uae`` will be launched inside that directory
        
        Next, after ``fs-uae`` quit, there will:
        
        - Create archive containing save state with name like the configuration file
          with additional ``_save`` suffix. In this example it would be
          ``ChaosEngine_save.7z``.
        - Wipe out temporary directory
        
        archive
        -------
        
        Options used:
        
        * ``wrapper`` (required) with ``cd32`` as an value
        * ``wrapper_archive`` (required) path to the archive with assets (usually means
          whole system directories, floppies or hd images)
        * ``wrapper_gui_msg`` (optional) if set to "1", will display a graphical
          message during extracting files
        * ``wrapper_persist_data`` (optional) if set to "1", will compress (possibly
          changed) data, replacing original archive
        
        Example configuration:
        
        .. code:: ini
           :number-lines:
        
           [config]
           wrapper = archive
           wrapper_archive = Workbench_3.1.tar.bz2
           wrapper_gui_msg = 1
           wrapper_persist_data = 1
        
           ...
        
        And execution is as usual:
        
        .. code:: shell-session
        
           $ fs-uae-wrapper Workbench.fs-uae
        
        This module will do several steps (similar as with ``cd32`` wrapper):
        
        - create temporary directory
        - extract provided in configuration archive
        - extract save state (if exists)
        - copy configuration under name ``Config.fs-uae``
        - run the fs-uae emulator
        - create archive with save state (if save state directory place is *not* a
          global one)
        - optionally create new archive under the same name as the original one and
          replace it with original one.
        
        This module is quite useful in two use cases. First is a usual work with
        Workbench, where there is a need to keep changes of filesystem. Second is the
        opposite - if there is a need to test some software, but not necessary keep it
        in a Workbench, than it will act as a temporary copy of the system, so that
        next time fs-uae will be run, there will be no files of tested software
        cluttering around.
