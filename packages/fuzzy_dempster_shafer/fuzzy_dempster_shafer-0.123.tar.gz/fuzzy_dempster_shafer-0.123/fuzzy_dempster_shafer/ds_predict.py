##### PREDICTION FUNCTION
## Variables description
# train_object - valid data frame
# y_train - Specify your binary response variable

# measure_belief - (default value set to 1) the measure of belief
# uncertainty - (default value set to 0.1) the measure of uncertainty
# uncertainty_ab - (default value set to 0.055 the measure of uncertainty for overlapping classes
# last - a logical for whether the current fit is the final fit. Used primarily because of caret package
# lev -  the class levels of the outcome (or NULL in regression). For future model modification into more than binary outcome.
# classProbs - a logical for whether class probabilities should be computed.
# other setting the minimum value for set overlap
# belief_increase
# belief_decrease
