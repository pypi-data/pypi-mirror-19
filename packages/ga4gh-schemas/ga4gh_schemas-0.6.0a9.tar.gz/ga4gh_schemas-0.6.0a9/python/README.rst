====================
GA4GH Schemas Python
====================

This is the GA4GH schemas compiled as Protocol Buffers descriptors. It can be used 
describe and serialize genomics data using a standard interchange format.

You can install the schemas using `pip install ga4gh-schemas`.

.. code-block:: python

    import ga4gh.schemas.ga4gh.variants_pb2 as variants
    my_variant = variants.Variant(
        reference_name="1",
        start=1832,
        end=4123,
        reference_bases="A",
        alternate_bases=["C"])

Full documentation is available at `read-the-docs.org
<http://ga4gh-schemas.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

- To read more about how the GA4GH API uses Protocol Buffers, see here `here <http://ga4gh-schemas.readthedocs.io/en/stable/appendix/proto_intro.html>`_.

###########
Development
###########

First, checkout out the source tree, create a new virtual environment, and 
activate. Then you'll install the development requirements and process the 
*.proto into compiled Python bindings.

This requires having protoc >3.0.0 installed. You can find source and binary
releases `here <https://github.com/google/protobuf>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:ga4gh/schemas.git
    cd schemas
    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r python/dev-requirements.txt
    python setup.py develop
    cd python
    python -m nose tests

The generated protocol buffers bindings are not checked into the source tree,
but are generated by the developer when making changes. To regenerate the 
bindings you can run `python setup.py develop`, which will process the schemas
into the compiled python classes.

You can then make modifications to the files in `src/main/proto` and rerun the
compilation using the same method. If successful, it will overwrite any bindings2016-11-02
currently in the directory. If you are making and deleting new proto files, 
you may end up with compiled bindings in your directory that you aren't using.
These are ignored by git and if not imported, will not affect your code.

Making releases
###############

When releasing the package to PyPi, the release manager should guarantee the 
protocol version in `setup.py` matches the protocol version being released.

Since PyPi and the source code may provide different minor versions, release
notes for the PyPi package are maintained here.
