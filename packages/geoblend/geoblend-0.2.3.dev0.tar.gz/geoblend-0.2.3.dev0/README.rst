Geo Blend
=========

Geoblend implements `poisson blending 
<https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Fall07/Papers/Perez03.pdf>`_
in Python. Poisson blending is an imaging technique that imposes the color of one image onto another image. This implementation conserves the gradient field of the image being blended.
