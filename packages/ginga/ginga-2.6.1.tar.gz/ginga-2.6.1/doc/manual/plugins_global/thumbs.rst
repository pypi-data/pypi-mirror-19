The Thumbs plugin provides an index of all images viewed since the
program was started.  Clicking on a thumbnail navigates you directly to
that image.  Thumbs appear in cronological viewing history, with the
newest images at the bottom and the oldest at the top.  Hovering the
cursor over a thumbnail will show a tooltip that contains a couple of
useful pieces of metadata from the image.
