Gits
====

Gits is a web-based terminal emulator. The project is based on completely
reworked source code of `Ajaxterm
<https://github.com/antonylesuisse/qweb/tree/master/ajaxterm>`_. It understands
only Linux console escape and control sequences so far. The main goal of the
project is to be used in `OpenStack <https://openstack.org>`_ one day.
