Golix: Python.

A python library for `Golix
protocol <https://github.com/Muterra/doc-golix>`__ objects that is in
dire need of a complete rewrite.

Notes
=====

Todo (no particular order)
==========================

-  DOCUMENTATION.
-  Ensure immutability of all objects that define ``__hash__``
-  Packed lowlevel objects should probably be immutable.
-  Reassess return API for receiving things as a FirstPersonID. Should
   it return a tuple, as it is right now, or not? Should the object
   return be different from the payload return? Unpacking extracts
   pretty much everything you can get that's not protected by crypto.
   **I think probably transition API to "unpack" for the object,
   "receive" for the content.** And then receive will always return a
   single item.
-  Change hash generation to use hash.update method, and then finally
   call a .finalize
-  Test vectors for all crypto operations
-  Need ThirdPartyID for servers

   -  Cannot create anything
   -  Has no keys
   -  Copies most of the methods from FirstPartyID for unpacking, etc
   -  Can also verify objects

-  Should EVERYONE verify the entire dynamic chain (particularly re:
   consistent author), or just servers? Probably everyone. Which means
   that needs to be added. Except, because that is a state preservation
   issue, that needs to be handled downstream.
-  Consider wrapping all parsing errors in SecurityError
-  Consider adding functionality to prevent access to attributes on ex.
   static bindings when loading a packed object until the object has
   been verified with receive\_.

Done
----

-  [STRIKEOUT:Make handling of GHID objects symmetric. AKA, convert
   loaded SmartyParseObjects into utils.Ghid objects.] That was
   unexpectedly straightforward.
-  ~~Move trashtest into \_spec unit test file before substantial
   changes.~~ Might have broken since then though.
