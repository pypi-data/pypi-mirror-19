Description: Greco - Green Code learning game.
        
        Learn Green Code in a friendly way!
        
        Greco is a very basic typing game where a word in Green Code is
        displayed and then you need to type in using your keyboard.

        Consistently accurate typing will result in gaining a level and being
        rewarded with a silly catchphrase.
        
        Green code is a whimsical language so start slowly, don't take it
        seriously and don't forget to have fun!
        
        Requires PyGame to be installed (normal PyGame or pygame_sdl2, either
        will work).
