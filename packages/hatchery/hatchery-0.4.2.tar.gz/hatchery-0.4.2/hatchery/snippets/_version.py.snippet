# In order for hatchery to do its work, there must be a _version.py file
# in the root package.  This _version module must define a variable called
# __version__, which can then be imported elsewhere in the package and, more
# importantly, be imported in setup.py.  A fine _version.py file might look
# like this:

__version__ = 'managed by hatchery'
__version_info__ = '.'.split(__version__)
