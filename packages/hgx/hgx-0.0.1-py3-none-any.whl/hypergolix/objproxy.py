    by which normal python objects can be "dropboxed" into hypergolix.
    The proxy object, and not the original object, must be referenced.
    
    Several "magic method" / "dunder methods" are explicitly sent to the
    proxying object, instead of the proxied object:
        1.  __init__
        2.  __repr__
        3.  __hash__ (see note [1] below)
        4.  __eq__ (see note [2] below)
        5.  __dir__
    
    All other dunder methods will pass directly to the proxied object.
    If the proxied object does not support those methods, it will raise,
    but which exception vacies on a case-by-case basis.
    
    [1] Proxies are hashable if their ghids are defined, but unhashable
    otherwise. Note, however, that their hashes have nothing to do with
    their proxied objects. Also note that
        isinstance(obj, collections.Hashable)
    will always identify ObjProxies as hashable, regardless of their
    actual runtime behavior.
    
    [2] Equality comparisons, on the other hand, reference the proxy's
    state directly. So if the states compare equally, the two ObjProxies
    will compare equally, regardless of the proxy state (ghid, api_id,
    etc).
    
    Side note: as per python docs, support for magic methods ("dunder",
    or "double underscore" methods) is only reliable if declared
    directly and explicitly within the class.
