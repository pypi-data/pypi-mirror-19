    # librarian retention directly, because not all _GAO have a librarian 
    # counterpart. For example, debindings will basically never be associated
    # with a live GAO, so, if you decided to let GAO live-ness dictate the
    # librarian caching of "lite"weight objects, you would never cache a GDXX.
