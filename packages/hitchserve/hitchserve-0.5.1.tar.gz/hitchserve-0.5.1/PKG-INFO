Description: HitchServe
        ==========
        
        HitchServe is a UNIX service orchestration plugin for the Hitch testing
        framework.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Start a group of services in parallel by using a simple, declarative API.
        * Aggregates logs from all the services it runs and prints them together, labeled.
        * Provides API to print logs, tail logs as well as to tail service logs and 'listen' for specific lines.
        * Provides an API to auto-convert JSON log lines into JSON and to tail and listen for specific properties.
        * Asks politely first with a configurable signal (default: SIGTERM) to shut down services.
        * If the shutdown timeout is exceeded, sends SIGKILL to any misbehaving processes and all of their children and grandchildren.
        * Runs services with libfaketime and provides an API to change the time sent to their APIs.
        * Provides an API call to listen for and connect to any process's IPython kernel.
