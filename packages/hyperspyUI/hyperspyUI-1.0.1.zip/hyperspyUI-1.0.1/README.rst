HyperSpyUI tries to bring a streamlined user interface to the powerful
multi-dimensional analysis capabilities of HyperSpy_. HyperSpy is an open
source Python library which provides tools to facilitate data analysis of
multidimensional datasets.

HyperSpy aims at making it easy and natural to apply analytical procedures
that operate on an individual signal to multidimensional arrays, as well as
providing easy access to analytical tools that exploit the multidimensionality
of the dataset.

While the UI tries to create a simple and intuitive interface to HyperSpy, it
still retains the raw power of HyperSpy via the UIâ€™s built in IPython console,
which runs on the same Python kernel as the UI.
