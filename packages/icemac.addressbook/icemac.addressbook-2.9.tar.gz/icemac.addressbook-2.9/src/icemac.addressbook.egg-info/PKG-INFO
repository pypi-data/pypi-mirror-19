        2.9 (2017-01-06)
        ================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Add view `@@inspector` to see internals of the rendered view or object. This
          view can only be accessed as global administrator (the one who is able to
          create new address books).
        
        Bugs
        ----
        
        - Fix configuration error which might prevent the start-up in 2.8.
        
        Other
        -----
        
        - Rework roles management for administrators to allow in future permissions
          which administrators do not get by default.
        
        - Bring test coverage including branches to 100 %.
        
        
        2.8 (2016-08-28)
        ================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Store timestamp of last log-in and render it in the principals list.
        
        2.7.1 (2016-06-26)
        ==================
        
        - Update to an `icemac.ab.locales` version which has complete translations
          for all address book and calendar features.
        
        
        2.7 (2016-06-25)
        ================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Render field descriptions (resp. notes of user defined fields) as hint text
          below the widget in the form.
        
        - Allow to select a default time zone in the address book's edit form. It is
          used for all users who do not have set their own time zone in the
          preferences.
        
        - Whitespace gets stripped from both ends of entered text values. Excluded are
          only the text fields in the `update` search result handler.
        
        Other
        -----
        
        - Update most libraries needed for the address book to their newest versions.
        
        - Get rid of dependency on ``classproperty``.
        
        2.6.4 (2016-04-16)
        ==================
        
        - Enable versioning in `fanstatic` so the no force-reload is needed to get the
          new CSS file versions.
        
        2.6.3 (2016-04-16)
        ==================
        
        - Allow to run `icemac.ab.calendar` 1.8 with this address book version.
        
        
        2.6.2 (2016-03-12)
        ==================
        
        - Render more form error messages in red.
        
        
        2.6.1 (2016-03-08)
        ==================
        
        - Fix backup and restore scripts which where broken due to updating to ZODB
          4.x.
        
        
        2.6 (2016-03-05)
        ================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Add javascript date picker to date fields.
        
        - iCal export of birth dates now includes birth year, too.
        
        - Add new `time` data type for user defined fields.
        
        - Render time picker for `time` fields.
        
        Fixes
        -----
        
        - Store ``datetime`` values in UTC.
        
        Other
        -----
        
        - Update most libraries needed for address book to newest versions.
        
        - No longer depend on ZTK but build up our own list.
        
        - Lint JavaScript files.
        
        - Rewrite tests to use py.test.
        
        - Update Selenium tests to Webdriver.
        
        - Move some functionality only needed in `icemac.ab.importer` there.
        
        - Drop `.utils.site()` in favour of `zope.component.hooks.site()`.
