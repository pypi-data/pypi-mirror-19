        Change log
        ==========
        
        
        3.0 (2017-02-04)
        ================
        
        Backward incompatible changes
        -----------------------------
        
        - Update to `py.test >= 2.8`. This version no longer allows a fixture to depend
          on an equally named fixture in another package. This requires a restructuring
          of the fixtures: Packages depending on `icemac.addressbook` can no longer
          e. g. depend the `zcmlS` fixture but have to provide there own full blown
          ZCML fixture. The fixtures which can be reused where moved to
          ``icemac.addressbook.fixtures``. ``icemac.addressbook.conftest`` should no
          longer be used or imported from foreign packages as this leads to problems
          with the new py.test version. The reusable helper functions have been moved
          to ``icemac.addressbook.testing``.
        
        
        Other
        -----
        
        - Update most libraries needed for the address book to their newest versions.
        
        
        2.10 (2017-01-20)
        =================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Add a search result handler which renders a list of the selected persons with
          a check-box in front.
        
        - Style text input fields better.
        
        - Style the print output properly.
        
        Other
        -----
        
        - Update most libraries needed for the address book to their newest versions.
        
        - Pack the ZODB during update to a newer address book version.
        
        
        2.9 (2017-01-06)
        ================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Add view `@@inspector` to see internals of the rendered view or object. This
          view can only be accessed as global administrator (the one who is able to
          create new address books).
        
        Bugs
        ----
        
        - Fix configuration error which might prevent the start-up in 2.8.
        
        Other
        -----
        
        - Rework roles management for administrators to allow in future permissions
          which administrators do not get by default.
        
        - Bring test coverage including branches to 100 %.
