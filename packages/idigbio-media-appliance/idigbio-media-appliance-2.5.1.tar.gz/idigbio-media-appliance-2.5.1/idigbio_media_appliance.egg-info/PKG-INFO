        =======================
        iDigBio Media Appliance v2
        
        The iDigBio Media Appliance was formerly known as the iDigBio Ingestion Tool or Image upload tool.
        
        This new iDigBio Media Appliance has been generalized to handle additional media types and is not limited to images.
        
        The media appliance should work on 64 bit linux and OSX, and on 32 and 64 bit windows.
        
        Python 3.5 is *required* for OSX installs. Python 3.5 is recommended (Anaconda install packaging is provided in the releases) for all platforms, but python 2.7 should work on linux and windows platforms.
