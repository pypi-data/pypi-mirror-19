img2pdf-legacy-python: Fork of img2pdf
======================================

This is a fork of the [img2pdf library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/img2pdf/)
maintained by Johannes Schauer, intended for use in legacy python (Python 2)
installations. It is distributed under the LGPL3 license. It is recommended
that you use the upstream version if possible, since it runs on modern
versions of Python.

No pull requests will be accepted, other than:
- Compatibility fixes with Python 2.
- Merges from the upstream img2pdf library.
