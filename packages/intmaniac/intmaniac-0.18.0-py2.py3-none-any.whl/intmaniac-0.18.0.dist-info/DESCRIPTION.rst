CHANGELOG
=========

0.18.0
------

Date: 2017-01-23

- FIX: broader version compatibility with docker APIs (don't use stupid 1.24 default of the python client)


0.17.0
------

Date: 2017-01-20

- FEATURE: Docker 1.12+ compatibility
- FEATURE: Full interaction between docker-compose stack and test container (volumes, etc.)
- KNOWN BUGS: Docs / examples needed :)


0.16.1
------

Date: 2016-06-14

- Fixed bug in in-test exception handling


0.16.0
------

Date: 2016-05-24

- Fixed API version conflict (hopefully)
- Changed default behavior: Pulling images now default, has to be explicitly disabled if unwanted.


0.15.1, 0.15.2
--------------

Date: 2016-05-24

- Syntax fixes for Python <3.5


0.15.0
------

Date: 2016-05-24

- Added ``--no-format-output`` parameter which disables any output formatting. The output from the tester image is passed through without modifications.
- Mid-size internal refactoring, using docker-compose wrapper class now


0.14.0
------

Date: 2016-05-23

- Using docker python libraries internally now. The container now only needs ``/var/run/docker.sock`` mounted
- More optimizations still needed, but a lot more robust now. I hope.


0.13.0
------

Date: 2016-05-12

- Added replacement of ``%%ENV_VAR%%`` tags in the intmaniac file itself. Only global settings (e.g. from the command line) are used, of course.


0.12.0
------

Date: 2016-04-22

- Added ``-o/--output`` command line parameter


0.11.3
------

Date: 2016-04-21

- Fixed bug in container name extraction for older ``docker-compose`` versions


0.11.2
------

Date: 2016-04-20

- Fixed non-processing of environment settings from the cmdline
- Fixed docker-compose output evaluation
- Updated failure behavior during environment setup
- Updated tests accordingly
- Updated README with more and more precise information


0.11.1
------

Date: 2016-04-20 (unreleased)

- Fixed bug in config file parsing


0.11.0
------

Date: 2016-04-19 (unreleased)

- v3 file format implemented.
- ``pre:`` and ``post:`` hooks implemented for tester_configs (untested)


0.10.0
------

Date: 2016-04-15 (unreleased)

- Fully incompatible rewrite because of new test file format "v2"
- New internal test mechanism
- v3 file format already planned (v2 is only one test, v3 is a matrix test)


0.9.5
-----

Date: 2016-04-12

- Fixed bug with unassigned variable


0.9.4
-----

Date: 2016-04-11

-------------

Date: 2016-03-02

- Fixed console invocation bug in three attempts
- Fixed bug in main execution loop
- Added test for main execution loop


0.9.0
-----

- Removed multi-threaded execution of tests / test sets
- Changed file format (moved ``test_commands`` out of ``meta`` subdict)
- Changed file format (no more "arrays of test sets")
- Changed execution order of tests (in alphabetical order by test set key), same for tests
- Added explicit test for ``test_commands``, ``meta.test_before``, ``meta.test_after`` command construction
