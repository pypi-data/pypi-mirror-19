Chat rooms
==========

Gitter
------

We use Gitter for both personal and group chat. Our main chat room is:

- `<https://gitter.im/inveniosoftware/invenio>`_

There are several other chat rooms for individual repositories.

Google Hangouts

We used to use "Invenio Developers" hangout, but it fell out of use. People are
mostly on Gitter nowadays.

IRC
---

We used to use ``#invenio`` IRC channel at ``irc.freenode.net``, but it fell out
of use. People are mostly on Gitter nowadays.
