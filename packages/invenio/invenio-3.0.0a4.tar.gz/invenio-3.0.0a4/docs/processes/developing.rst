.. _contributing-documentation:

1. **Contributing documentation?** ReST and Sphinx. Contribute as code.

2. **Contributing I18N translations?** GNU gettext. See :ref:`i18n`.

.. _contributing-code:

3. **Contributing code?**

   i. Read `The Zen of Python <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python>`_.

   ii. Read `Python Anti-Patterns
       <http://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/>`_.
   iii. Code with style. Plug `pycodestyle
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycodestyle>`_ (`PEP-8
        <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_), `pydocstyle

        <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_), `Flake8
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8>`_, `ISort
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/isort>`_ tools into your editor.


   iv. Use sensible commit history. (See below.)

   v. Run kwalitee checks locally.

      - ``kwalitee check message master..my-feature-branch``
      - ``kwalitee check files master..my-feature-branch``
      - ``kwalitee check authors master..my-feature-branch``
      - ``kwalitee prepare release master..my-feature-branch``

   vi. Follow egoless programming principles. See :ref:`code-of-conduct`.
