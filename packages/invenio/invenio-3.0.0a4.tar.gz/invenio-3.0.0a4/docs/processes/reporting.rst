Reporting principles
====================

Have you encountered a bug or do you have a new feature request? Here are a few
tips on our issue reporting practices.

.. _if-it-aint-on-github-it-does-not-exist:

1. **If it ainâ€™t on GitHub, it does not exist.** Please document every bug or
   every feature request on GitHub in respected repositories.

.. _found-security-issue-alert-use-privately:

2. **Found security issue? Alert us privately.** If you find a security issue
   that has a possible dangerous exploit, please alert us privately at
   ``<info@inveniosoftware.org>``. This will allow us to distribute a security
   patch before potential attackers look at the issue.

.. _check-existing-issues-before-submitting:

3. **Check existing issues before submitting.** Please check opened or closed
   issued before submitting. Somebody else might have had the same issue as you.

.. _describe-concrete-steps-how-to-reproduce-a-problem:

4. **Describe concrete steps how to reproduce a problem.** Which version you
   used? What you did? What was the outcome? What you expected instead?

.. _submit-a-use-case-submit-a-test-case-code:

5. **Submit a use case. Submit a test case code.** Please clarify the use case
   in mind with as much explicit detail as necessary. Other Invenio instances
   may have different implicit assumptions than you.

.. _get-involved-comment-ad-advise-on-other-issues:

6. **Get involved! Comment and advise on other issues.** Help the community and
   see your responsibilites widen.

.. _join-invenio-chat-room:

7. **Join Invenio chat room.** Sometimes a quick chat may be better than long
   GitHub issue.

.. _watch-notifications-in-interested-repositories:

9. **Watch notifications in interested repositories.** Subscribe to GitHub
   notifications to stay up-to-date on what is going on.
