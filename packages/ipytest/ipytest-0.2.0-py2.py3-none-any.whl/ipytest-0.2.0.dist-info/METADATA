# ipytest - unit tests in IPython notbeooks

Sometimes quick experiments in IPython grow large and you find yourself wanting 
unit tests. This module aims to make testing code in IPython notebooks easy. At 
its core, it offers a test runner that execute all tests defined inside the 
notebook environment. It is also designed to make the transfer of the tests into
proper python modules easy.

## Example

```python

# coding: utf-8
# In[1]:
from __future__ import print_function, division, absolute_import
import ipytest

# In[2]:
def fibonacci(i):
    """Compute the fibonacci sequence.

    >>> [fibonacci(n) for n in range(7)]
    [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

    """
    if i == 0 or i == 1:
        return 1
    return fibonacci(i - 1) + fibonacci(i - 2)

# In[3]:
ipytest.clean_tests("test_fibonacci*")

def test_fibonacci_0():
    assert fibonacci(0) == 1

def test_fibonacci_1():
    assert fibonacci(1) == 1

def test_fibonacci_2():
    assert fibonacci(2) == 2

def test_fibonacci_3():
    assert fibonacci(3) == 3

def test_fibonacci_4():
    assert fibonacci(4) == 5

def test_fibonacci_5():
    assert fibonacci(5) == 8

def test_fibonacci_6():
    assert fibonacci(6) == 13

ipytest.run_tests(doctest=True)     
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install ipytest
```

## Features

- simple interface
- builds on standard unittest
- support for doctests
- support for pandas and numpy.

## Reference

### ipytest.run_tests(doctest=False, items=None)

Run all tests in the given items dictionary.

**Arguments:**

- `doctest`: if True search for doctests. 
- `items`: the globals object containing the tests. If `None` is given, the 
    globals object is determined from the call stack.

### ipytest.clean_tests(pattern="test*", items=None)

Delete tests with names matching the given pattern.

In IPython the results of all evaluations are kept in global variables 
unless explicitly deleted. Therefore, previous definitions will still be found when tests are renamed but not explicitly deleted. 

An effecitve pattern is to start with the cell containing tests with a call 
to `clean_tests`, then defined all test cases, and finally call `run_tests`.
This way renaming tests works as expected.

**Arguments:**

- `pattern`: a glob pattern used to match the tests to delete.
- `items`: the globals object containing the tests. If `None` is given, the 
    globals object is determined from the call stack.

### ipytest.collect_tests(doctest=False, items=None)

Collect all test cases and return a `unittest.TestSuite`.

The arguments are the same as for `ipytest.run_tests`.

### ipytest.assert_equals(a, b, *args, **kwargs)

Compare two objects and throw and exception if they are not equal.

This method uses `ipytest.get_assert_function` to determine the assert 
implementation to use depending on the argument type.

**Arguments**

- `a`, `b`: the two objects to compare.
- `args`, `kwargs`: (keyword) arguments that are passed to the underlying 
    test function. This option can, for example, be used to set the 
    tolerance when comparing `numpy.array` objects

### ipytest.get_assert_function(a, b)

Determine the assert function to use depending on the arguments.

If either object is a `numpy .ndarray`, a `pandas.Series`, a 
`pandas.DataFrame`, or `pandas.Panel`, it returns the assert functions 
supplied by `numpy` and `pandas`. Otherwise, it defaults to 
`ipytest.unittest_assert_equals`

### ipytest.unittest_assert_equals(a, b)

Compare two objects with the `assertEqual` method of `unittest.TestCase`.
