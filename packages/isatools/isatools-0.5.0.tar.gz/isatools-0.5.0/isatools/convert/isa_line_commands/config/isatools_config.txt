===== ISA Tools Configuration ======

This file explains how to configure the BII components ISATAB validator and ISATAB loader.

Validator is a graphical tool that allows to verify  an ISATAB submission. It checks both that the structure complains
with the ISATAB specification and the biological meaning of the information represented in a submission archive.

The Loader is used for loading a submission into the BII database. 


== Configuration Directory ==

Every ISA Tool has this directory under the the tool installation path: 

  <tool-path>/config

This directory contains several configuration files, a description of them is provided in below.

Note for advanced users: should you need to change the location of this directory, it can be done by editing the 
launching script (run.sh), which is present in every tool, and changing the Java property "bioinvindex.config-path". 
The launching command in the script will look like:  

java -Dbioinvindex.config-path -cp isatools_deps.jar org.isatools.gui.validator.ValidatorInvoker

  
== ISAConfigurator Files == 

This is located under 

  <launching-path>/config/isa_configurator
  
It contains .xml files that are produced by the ISA-Configurator. Hence, these files specify various information on the 
sample and assay files that are expected to be read by the ISA Tools, including validation information (e.g: a certain field
must be present and must have values from a given ontology). 


== Assay file locations: data_locations.xml == 

This file allows to specify, for each pair of assay end point and assay technology, where the files about the corresponding
assay type have to be copied when an ISATAB submission is loaded in the BII infrastrucure. Loading consists of saving information
in the BII database AND copying the ISATAB files (meta-data files such as investigation or sample files, and experimental data files)
to destinations defined in this file. Such destinations must be file system paths that are accessible from both the machine where 
the loader is run and the JBOSS server that runs the BII web application. 

Furthermore, the data locations configuration file allows to specify how the files for a certain assay type are accessible via 
web, i.e.: the URLs that will be used by the web application to point to the files.

More details are explained in the file itself


== Database and Lucene Index Engine Configuration: hibernate.properties ==

this is the usual file used by Hibernate. Mainly it contains configuration info about the database where 
ISATAB data are saved. This include the DB's index, which is managed by the Lucene component, the directory where the
index information is stored must be specified in hibernate.properties as well. 


== General Configuration: config.properties == 

This file is used to setup general properties that are ISA Tools-specific


== Log4J Configuration: log4j.properties ==

This is the usual configuration file for Log4J, the logging component that affect the level of user reporting for the 
BII tools. See Log4J documentation for details.
