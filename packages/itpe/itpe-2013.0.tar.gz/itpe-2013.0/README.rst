ITPE
====

Scripts for generating the masterpost HTML for ITPE (the Informal Twitter
Podfic Exchange).

Installation
------------

Install these scripts by running:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install itpe

or:

.. code-block:: console

   pipsi install itpe

Usage
-----

For the 2013 version, you need to create a subdirectory of your home directory
called ``Podfic``.  (For example, ``/Users/alexwlchan/Podfic``.)

Save the CSV file of all the entires as ``itpe-treats.csv`` in this directory,
then run ``itpe``.  This will create a new file called ``itpe-treats.html`` in
the same directory.  This file contains the HTML to use for the master post.
