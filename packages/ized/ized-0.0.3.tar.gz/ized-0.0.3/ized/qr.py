    The main strength about this implementation lies in the flexibility
    provided by being able to exchange the map and reduce functions. For
    example, many parallelization libraries provide efficient implementations
    of the map step that could be plugged in to obtain parallel QR
    decompositions.  Alternatively, iterator implementations of map and reduce
    might be used to reduce the memory footprint incurred in the computation.

    Args:
        X_blocks: an iterable over matrix chunks
        n: number of rows after which a chunk is transformed
        map_func: the map function that takes a function and an iterable and
            returns the iterable over function values
        reduce_func: the reduce function that takes a function of two arguments
            and an iterable and returns a value constructed by applying the
            function to the first and second elements of the iterable, and then
            repeatedly applying the function to the result and the next element
            from the iterable.

        matrix chunks can be written as X=QR with an orthogonal matrix Q
