Description: jsonrpc_pyclient
        ================
        jsonrpc_pyclient is a transport-agnostic json-rpc 2.0 and 1.0 client library primarily intended for use with
        libjson-rpc-cpp_ but can be used with other json-rpc server implementations.
        
        .. _libjson-rpc-cpp: https://github.com/cinemast/libjson-rpc-cpp
        
        This library is intended to be used with libjson-rpc-cpp's stubgenerator,
        which takes a json-formatted specification file, and can then return server
        and client stubs in various languages; the python client stub generator was
        created to use this library. For more information on using the stubgenerator,
        refer to libjson-rpc-cpp's documentation.

            >>> connector = socketclient.TcpSocketClient("127.0.0.1", 8032)
            >>> client = ClientStub(connector)
            >>> result = client.addNumbers(4, 5)
