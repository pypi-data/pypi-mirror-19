Description: 
        You know that time you wanted to get some world data but it was a dreadful
        jungle of bad documentation, requests that make very little sense, ridiculously
        complicated data formats (SDMX?), and in the end you just said fuck this
        and decided to do something else?
        
        This is an attempt at making world data mining suck a bit less.
        
        Currently available data sets:
        
        * World Bank
        * OECD
        * WHO
        * Eurostat
        
        Source and (minimal) documentation `here <https://github.com/myyc/kleptes/>`_.
