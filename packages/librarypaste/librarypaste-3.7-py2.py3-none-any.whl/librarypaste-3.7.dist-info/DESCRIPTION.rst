Usage
=====

Launch with the ``librarypaste``
command or with ``python -m librarypaste``. The library will host the service
on ``[::0]:8080`` by default. Pass cherrypy config files on the command line
to customize behaivor.

By default, the server saves pastes to the file system  in ``./repo`` using the
JSON store, but there is support for a MongoDB backend as well.

client (including a clipboard helper) and Mac OS X App.
