        A batched log handler that sends the log output to Google Cloud Logging service using
        the Google cloud client library. When creating this handler, authentication for GCloud should

        http://gcloud-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gcloud-auth.html.

        worth of log records before sending all those log records in a batch.
