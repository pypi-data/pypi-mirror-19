Description: Maspy
        =====
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        Maspy is a Python library with the aim to provide simple, convenient and
        versatile access to proteomics data of bottom up experiments. To achieve this
        it features an internal data representation that facilitates comfortable use
        of this data. Maspy is intended as a tool for researchers that allows the
        combination of different software to generate customized and scriptable data
        processing workflows and to enable interactive data analysis with Python.

        Installation
        ------------
        For Windows users without Python we recommend installing the
        `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ Python package provided by
        Continuum Analytics.
        
        NOTE: The current release of maspy will soon be submitted to
        `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/>`_, which allows installation with PIP, as
        described below:
        
        For installing maspy and its dependencies we recommend using
        `PIP <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_.
        
        Installing maspy from the command line with PIP after the release:
        
        ```
        pip install maspy
        ```
        
        Compatibility
