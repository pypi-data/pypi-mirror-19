** class hierarchy
- Expression
  - Operator
  - Atom
    - Symbol
    - Wildcard
      - WildcardDot
      - WildcardSymbol (low priority)
      - WildcardStar
** Pattern class
- patt_expr
- constraint
- what to do to linearizing them?
** ReplacementRule class
- Pattern
- Replacement
* one-to-one syntactic matching necessary?
- if yes, implement
* implement discrimination nets (many-to-one, syntactic)
- linearize patterns
* general stuff
- be carefull with optimizations regarding copy: I think at the moment, I don't copy symbols at all, because I never modify them. If you want to modify symbols, don't forget to copy them.
- function attributes (associative, ...) as class variables?
- let's collect test/special cases in mathematica
