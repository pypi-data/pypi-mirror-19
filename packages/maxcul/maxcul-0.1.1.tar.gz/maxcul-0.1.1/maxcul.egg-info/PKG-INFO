Description: # About MaxCul for Python
        
        This Module is forked from this Project https://github.com/jokey2k/MoritzServer.
        It can communicate over a serial connection and a cul stick with MAX! Devices build by eQ-3 http://www.eq-3.de/produkte/max.html.
        
        The CUL (or CC1101 USB Lite) is a USB Stick, which sends and receive Packages in the 868Mhz frequency.
        The FHEM community developed a open firmeware for the stick and so the MAX! protocol ist only one of many protocols you can use with this stick.
        I build my own stick with this instruction: https://wiki.fhem.de/wiki/Selbstbau_CUL
        But you can buy it for example here: http://www.busware.de/tiki-index.php?page=CUL
        
        To install the dependecys use this command.
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        After that you can start a test server with this command.
        ```
        python bin/moritz-server.py --cul-path /dev/ttyUSB0
        ```
        This open a small webserver with some tools to control your devices and see there states.
