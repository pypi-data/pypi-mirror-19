"""
This module implements some facilities that makes it very easy to
rework arbitrary SQLAlchemy queries applying some filter conditions,
constraining the actual selected columns, batched results, obtaining a
meta description of the resultset, eventually marshalled in JSON, or
as a list of plain dictionaries instead of the SQLAlchemy rows, and so
on.

This is the basic mechanism used in SoL, a Pylons application, to
expose an arbitrary dataset in JSON thru a ``Controller``, using the
:func:`metapensiero.sqlalchemy.proxy.pylons.proxy` decorator that
automatically glues the proxied thing to the web request. SoL's ExtJS
layer uses the meta description to build the data grids.
