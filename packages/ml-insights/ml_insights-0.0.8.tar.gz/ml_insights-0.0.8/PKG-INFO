Description: ML Insights
        ===========
        
        Package to understand Supervised ML Models.  This package has been tested with Scikit-Learn and XGBoost library.  It should work with any machine learning library that has a `predict` and `predict_proba` methods for regression and classification estimators.
        
        The main entry point to this package is `ModelXRay` class.  Instantiate it with the model and data.  The data can be what the model was trained with, but inteded to be used for out of bag or test data to see how the model performs when one feature is changed, holding everything else constant.

        We have not tested this for unsupervied models.
