        =====
        
        Ping multiple hosts concurrently and find the fastest to you.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install -U mping
        
        Usages
        ------
        
        Just tell which host is the fastest:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            mping host1.com host2.com host3.com
        
        Get hosts from a file, and ping them:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            mping -p PATH/TO/THE/FILE.txt
        
            Read **Input File** section below for more details.
        
        The results will be like this:
        
        ::
        
            host      | count, loss%, min/avg/max
            ----------|--------------------------
            host1.com | 99, 0.0%, 5.4/6.8/14.1
            host2.com | 90, 0.0%, 23.8/33.5/39.5
            host3.com | 77, 0.4%, 37.4/39.1/43.6
        
            The ``count`` number represents how many replies returned from each
            host.
        
        Also check out the help stuff for more instructions:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            mping -h
        
        Input File
        ----------
        
        You can use either a plain text file or a Json file as the ``-p`` /
        ``--path`` argument.
        
        **Plain Text File**
        
        When use a plain text file, just place each host in a line.
        
        For example:
        
        ::
        
            host1.com
            host2.com
            host3.com
        
        **Json File**
        
        You can also use a json file as the input hosts, and below is the 2
        modes:
        
        Put hosts in a list:
        
        ``json [     "host1.com",     "host2.com",     "host3.com" ]``
        
        Or in an object (dict) with names:
        
        ``json {     "S1": "host1.com",     "S2": "host3.com",     "S3": "host3.com" }``
        
            The names will be printed in the results.
