        First things first
        ==================
        
        This project is based on the `python-vdmlab` package from the 
        van der Meer lab at Dartmouth College (https://github.com/vandermeerlab),
        created by Emily Irvine (https://github.com/emirvine). It is also inspired
        by the neuralensemble.org NEO project (http://neo.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.0/).
        
        Scope of this work
        ==================
        The nelpy object model is expected to be quite similar to python-vdmlab object
        model, which in turn has significant overlap with neuralensemble.org's neo 
        model. However, the nelpy object model extends the former by making binned data
        first class citizens, and by changing the API for indexing and extracting subsets
        of data, as well as making "functional support" an integral part of the model. It
        (nelpy) is impler and less well developed than neo, and specifically lacks in 
        terms of physical units and complex object hierarchies and nonlinear relationships.
        However, nelpy again makes binned data a core object, and nelpy further aims to 
        add additional analysis code including filtering, smoothing, position analysis,
        subsampling, interpolation, spike rate estimation, spike generation / synthesis,
        ripple detection, Bayesian decoding, and so on. In short, nelpy is more than just
        an object model, but the nelpy core is designed to be a flexible, readable, yet
        powerful object model for neuroelectrophysiology.
