Introduction
============

note0 is a command-line note taking application written for Linux. It provides
a sync functionality for which your notes are stored in your Google Drive and 
can be accessed and modified on other PC's where this application is installed. 
The application consists of a client-side and server-side. The following subsections
provide some more information depending on whether you need sync or not.

I don't need sync
-----------------

If you do not wish to make use of the sync facility and are content with storing
and accessing your notes locally, you do not need to consider the server-side. 
In this case see the subsection *client-side* under *Installation* to install
the client side.

I need sync
-----------

If you want to make use of the sync functionality, you need to install the client-side
(as you would if you didn't want sync). You would also need to have a server running. 
To setup your own server, instructions are availabe under the subsection *server-side* 
which is under *Installation*. Then, create an account with the email associated with 
you Drive and a password for this account. You can now log in and start using the 
application. If you need the notes on another PC install the application there and 
log in using the email and password provided during creation of note0 account.

Installation
============

Client-side
-----------

To install the client-side:
::

	$ pip install note0

Now you need to set it up (one-time only, which creates a new directory in your home directory):
::

	$ note0 -s

To start using the application:
::

	$ note0

Use the *help* command (after application has been started) to list all possible commands:
::

	note0> help

Server-side
-----------

To setup your own server, you require

- MySQL
- npm
- Node.js version 6.9.2 (the server-side wasn't tested using other versions)
- To use console.developers.google.com to enable the Drive API and create an
  OAuth Client ID and download the JSON file consisting of the Client ID,
  Client Secret etc.
- Downloaded copy of *server.js* and *package.json* from this project. These files can be found in the *server*
  directory of this project.

Create a directory (the directory will be assumed to have the name *server_directory* 
for reference but it is not necessary to name it so) where files required to setup 
the server will be present.

Download the *server.js* and *package.json* file to this directory. Rename the JSON file consisting of the
Client ID etc. to *client_secrets.json* and move it to this directory if not already present here.
Make this directory into your working directory to install dependencies of *server.js* as follows:

::

	$ npm install

After you have installed MySQL, open the *server.js* file and locate the lines where
a connection to the MySQL database is created. This would be near the beginning of the script
and would look like this:

.. code:: javascript

	var connection = mysql.createConnection({
		user     : 'usernamehere' ,
		password : 'wxyz',
		database : 'drive'
	});

Change the value of *user* (which is currently *usernamehere*) and *password* (which is currently *wxyz*) to your MySQL credentials. 

Now create a database named *drive*:

.. code:: sql

	mysql> CREATE DATABASE drive;
In that database create two tables *users* and *sessions*:

.. code:: sql

	mysql> USE drive;
	mysql> CREATE TABLE users (email VARCHAR(256), pswd VARCHAR(256), token VARCHAR(1024), tkey VARCHAR(256), iv VARCHAR(256),tkey_key VARCHAR(256), directory_id VARCHAR(256));
	mysql> CREATE TABLE sessions (email VARCHAR (256), skey VARCHAR (512));

Now start the server:

::

	$ node server.js

Usage example
=============

::

	$ note0

	Welcome to note0
	Version 0.1.0

	Type 'help' to know more

	Log in status: You are not logged in

	 note0>  new

	Successfully created new note

	 note0>  open

	Note number: 0
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This is a sample 
	file used in the README of
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Which note do you want to open (note number): 0
	Note successfully saved

	 note0>  delete

	Note number: 0
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This is a sample 
	file used in the README of
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Which note do you want to delete (note number): 0
	Are you sure you want to delete note number 0 (y/n)?: y
	Note successfully deleted

	 note0>  open

	You do not have any notes

	 note0>  delete

	You do not have any notes

	 note0>  help

	Documented commands (type help <topic>):
	========================================
	change_password  delete          exit  login   new   set_editor  status
	create_account   delete_account  help  logout  open  set_url     sync  

	 note0>  sync 

	Sync not possible since you are not logged in

	 note0>  help exit

	Use this command to exit the application

	 note0>  exit
	$

Notes are opened in the editor that can be set using *set_editor*.

How note0 works
===============

The client-side consists of a directory *.note0* that is created in the home directory. 
It stores the notes and a config file containing information regarding who is logged in, 
address of the server and more. The server stores information on user accounts, 
login sessions etc. When the server receives a request, for example to upload a note, it makes use 
of the Google API to upload it to the user's drive.

A note0 account is required to make use of the sync functionality and if an account is created
then notes can be stored locally and on Drive. If a note0 account is not created then notes can
only be stored locally.
