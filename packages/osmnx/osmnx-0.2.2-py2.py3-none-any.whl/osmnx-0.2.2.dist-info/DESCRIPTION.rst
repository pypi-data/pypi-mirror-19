**OSMnx** is a package to easily download, construct, project, visualize, and analyze complex street 
networks from OpenStreetMap in Python with NetworkX. 

You can get a city's or neighborhood's walking, driving, or biking network with a single line of Python 
code. Then you can easily visualize cul-de-sacs or one-way streets, plot shortest-path routes, or 
calculate stats like intersection density, average node connectivity, betweenness centrality, etc.

See the examples and demos on `GitHub`_.
