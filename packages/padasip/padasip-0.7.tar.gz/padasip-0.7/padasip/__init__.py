This library is designed to simplify adaptive signal 
processing tasks within python
(filtering, prediction, reconstruction, classification).
For code optimisation,
this library uses `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ for array operations.

Also in this library is presented some new methods
for adaptive signal processing.
The library is designed to be used with datasets and also with 
real-time measuring (sample-after-sample feeding).
