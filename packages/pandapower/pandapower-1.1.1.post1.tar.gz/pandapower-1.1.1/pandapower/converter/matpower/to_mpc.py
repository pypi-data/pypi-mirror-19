    """
    This function converts a pandapower net to a matpower case files (.mat) version 2.
    Note: python is 0-based while Matlab is 1-based.

    INPUT:

        **net** - The pandapower net.

        **filename** - File path + name of the mat file which will be created.

    OPTIONAL:

        **init** (str, "results") - initialization method of the loadflow
        For the conversion to a mpc, the following options can be chosen:

            - "flat"- flat start with voltage of 1.0pu and angle of 0Â° at all buses as initial solution
            - "results" - voltage vector of last loadflow from net.res_bus is copied to the mpc

        **calculate_voltage_angles** (bool, False) - copy the voltage angles from pandapower to the mpc

            If True, voltage angles are copied from pandapower to the mpc. In some cases with
            large differences in voltage angles (for example in case of transformers with high
            voltage shift), the difference between starting and end angle value is very large.
            In this case, the loadflow might be slow or it might not converge at all. That is why
            the possibility of neglecting the voltage angles of transformers and ext_grids is
            provided to allow and/or accelarate convergence for networks where calculation of
            voltage angles is not necessary.

            The default value is False because pandapower was developed for distribution networks.
            Please be aware that this parameter has to be set to True in meshed network for correct
            results!

        **trafo_model** (str, "t")  - transformer equivalent circuit model
        Pandapower provides two equivalent circuit models for the transformer:

            - "t" - transformer is modelled as equivalent with the T-model. This is consistent with PowerFactory and is also more accurate than the PI-model. We recommend using this transformer model.
            - "pi" - transformer is modelled as equivalent PI-model. This is consistent with Sincal, but the method is questionable since the transformer is physically T-shaped. We therefore recommend the use of the T-model.

    EXAMPLE:

        import pandapower.converter as pc

        import pandapower.networks as pn

        net = pn.case9()

        pc.pp2mpc(net)
