Getting Started
---------------

Should I install PandExo or use the online interface? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install if... 

- I will be using PandExo for more than 10 runs 
- I want to submit bash runs 
- I want to use the online GUI but don't want to be subject to any slow downs because of high user frequency 
- I want to be able to use plotting functions to analyze my output 

Install EVEN if... 

- I am scared of Python

Do not install if...

- I will only be using PandExo fewer than 10 times
- I have a student who can install it for me

Requires
~~~~~~~~

- Python >2.7, that's it
- Pandeia (hopefully we will not have to install this manually)
