[panflute](http://scorreia.com/software/panflute/) is a Python package that makes creating Pandoc filters fun.

For a detailed user guide, documentation, and installation instructions, see
<http://scorreia.com/software/panflute/>. If you want to contribute, head [here](/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Install

To install panflute, open the command line and type:

```bash
pip install panflute
```

- Support Python 2.7, 3.3 or later, pypy, and pypy3.
- On windows, the command line (``cmd``) must be run as administrator.

Alternatively, if you use Python3 only, you can install it with

```bash
pip3 install git+git://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute.git
```

An advantage of this later installation method is that it has better autocomplete hints:

## Uninstall

```
pip uninstall panflute
```

## Dev Install

After cloning the repo and opening the panflute folder:

`python setup.py install`
: installs the package locally

`python setup.py develop`
: installs locally with a symlink so changes are automatically updated

In addition, if you use python2, you need to pasteurize the code before running tests. Run `pasteurize -wnj 4 .` in this directory.
