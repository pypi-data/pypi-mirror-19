What is it
----------

Implementation of Fisher's permutation test.

The test is described in following publications:

- Fisher, R. A. (1935). The design of experiments. 1935. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh.

- Ernst, M. D. (2004). Permutation methods: a basis for exact inference. Statistical Science, 19(4), 676-685


How to install it
-----------------

Install with pip::

    $ pip install permutation_test



Command Line Script Usage
-------------------------

Example::
  
    permtest [path/to/data.csv] [groups_colname] [reference_group_name] -t [test_group_name]


Use help to get info about parameters::

    $ permtest -h

    usage: permtest [-h] [-t TESTGROUP]
                input_filepath treatment_column_name referencegroup

    positional arguments:
      input_filepath        e.g. path/to/my/data.csv, path to csv file with data
      treatment_column_name
                            name of column in the csv table that specifies the
                            group
      referencegroup        name of the reference group as named in the csv table

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -t TESTGROUP, --testgroup TESTGROUP
                            name of the test group as named in th csv table. If
                            not defined, test group is determined automatically.
       -a ALPHA, --alpha ALPHA
                             significance level alpha (between 0 and 1) If not
                             defined, alpha is set to 0.05.
       -m MULTI_COMP_CORR, --multi_comp_corr MULTI_COMP_CORR
                             perform multiple comparison correction with benjamini
                             hochberg procedure yes/no, If not defined, correction
                             is performed.
                      


Specifications of data structure in csv file
--------------------------------------------

- The csv should contain comma separated values. One ore more columns should contain measurement data.

- All columns need to have a name, specified in the first row.

- One column contains names for the groups

Example *my_data.csv*:

============ ============ ============ ===========
experiment_1 experiment_2 experiment_3 group_names
============ ============ ============ ===========
1.4          3            2.5          condition_2  
2            5            2            condition_1
5.6          3            17           condition_2
9            6.5          2            condition_1
17           5            13.0         condition_1
17           2            13.0         condition_3
12           8            18.7         condition_3
============ ============ ============ ===========


To perform tests for all experiments, where *condition_1* is the reference and *condition_2* is
the test data, run follwoing command::

    $ permtest my_data.csv group_names condition_1 -t condition_2

Often, it is convenient to save the output in a textfile::

    $ permtest my_data.csv group_names condition_1 -t condition_2 > my_test_result.txt



Python Library Use Example
--------------------------
::

    >>> import permutation_test as p
    >>> data = [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,5]
    >>> ref_data = [3,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,7]

    >>> p_value = p.permutation_test(data, ref_data)
    taking random subsample of size 20000 from 48620 possible permutations
    nr of mean diffs: 20000

The asccii art plot shows the ditribution of mean differences for the permutations. 
The ascii art plot is done with [AP](https://github.com/mfouesneau/asciiplot), a plotting package by Morgan Fouesneau.


If the number of possible combinations is grater than n_combinations_max,
a random subsample of size n_combinations_max is taken for histogram calculation.

If detailed is False, only (two-sided) p_value is returned,
i.e. the probability that data is not different from ref_data 

If detailed is True, one-sided p values and histogram data of 
mean differences is returned in a dict:

hist_data: distribution of mean differences for all permutations
p_value: two sided p_value (the probability that data is not
different from ref_data )
p_value_lower_than: the probability that mean of data is not 
lower than mean of ref_data
p_value_greater_than: the probability that mean of data is 
not grater than mean of ref_data
