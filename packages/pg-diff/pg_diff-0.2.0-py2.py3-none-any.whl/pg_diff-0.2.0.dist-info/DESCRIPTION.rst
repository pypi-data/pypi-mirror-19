        pg diff
        =======
        
        A simple tool to diff serveral properties of schemas in two postgresql
        databases.
        
        Now supported diff options are:
        
        -  table\_name
        -  table\_count
        -  table\_schema
        -  row\_count
        -  table\_size
        -  index\_size
        -  ``table_total_size``
        
        Why
        ===
        
        Recently I worked on database migration things, and very need a tool to
        analyze the consistency between source and target database. So I make
        this tool to some simple comparison, and it looks good to me:)
        
        Prerequisite
        ============
        
        You need to install ``postgresql`` firstly, because ``pg_diff`` will use
        ``psycopg2`` to execute some commands.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ``pip install pg_diff``
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ``pg_diff --type=table_count 'host=source dbname=test user=postgres password=secret port=5432' 'host=target dbname=test user=postgres password=secret port=5432' --verbose``
        
        ::
        
            Usage:
              pg_diff --type=T_NAME SOURCE_DSN TARGET_DSN [--verbose]
              pg_diff -h | --help
              pg_diff --version
        
            Arguments:
              SOURCE_DSN     dsn for source database, like "host=xxx dbname=test user=postgres password=secret port=5432"
              TARGET_DSN     dsn for target database, like "host=xxx dbname=test user=postgres password=secret port=5432"
        
            Options:
              --type=T_NAME  Type name to compare in category, valid input likes: table_name, table_count, table_schema, row_count, table size. index size, table_total_size
              -h --help      Show help info.
              --verbose      Show verbose information.
              --version      Show version.
        
        Implementation
        ==============
        
        Mainly using libraries below to make this tool:
        
        -  docopt==0.6.2
        -  schema==0.6.5
        -  deepdiff==2.5.1
        -  psycopg2==2.6.2
        
        And I use some SQL to query the status of schema, like table size, index
        size and etc.
        
        Contribution
        ============
        
        #. Fork the repository on GitHub.
        #. Make a branch off of master and commit your changes to it.
        #. Run the tests with ``tox``
        
        -  Either use ``tox`` to build against all supported Python versions (if
           you have them installed) or use ``tox -e py{version}`` to test
           against a specific version, e.g., ``tox -e py27`` or ``tox -e py33``.
        
        #. Submit a Pull Request to the master branch on GitHub.
        
        If youâ€™d like to have a development environment for ``pg_diff``, you
        should create a virtualenv and then do ``pip install -e .`` from within
        the directory.
