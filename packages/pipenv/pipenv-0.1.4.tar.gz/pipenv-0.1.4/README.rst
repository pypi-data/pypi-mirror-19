Pipenv: Sacred Marriage of Pipfile, Pip, & Virtualenv 
=====================================================

Pipenv is an experimental project that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds to the Python world. It harnesses `Pipfile <https://github.com/pypa/pipfile>`_, pip, and virtualenv into one single toolchain. It features very pretty terminal colors. 

It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your ``Pipfile`` as you install/uninstall packages. The ``lock`` command generates a lockfile (``Pipfile.lock``).

‚ò§ Features
----------

- Automatically finds your project home, recursively, by looking for a ``Pipfile``.
- Automatically generates a ``Pipfile``, if one doesn't exist.
- Automatically generates a ``Pipfile.lock``, if one doesn't exist. 
- Automatically creates a virtualenv in a standard location (``project/.venv``).
- Automatically adds packages to a Pipfile when they are installed.
- Automatically removes packages from a Pipfile when they are un-installed. 
- Also automatically updates pip.

The main commands are ``init``, which initializes the environment, ``install`` and ``uninstall``, and ``lock``, which generates a ``Pipfile.lock``. These are intended to replace ``$ pip install`` usage, as well as manual virtualenv management. 

- ``py`` will run the Python interpreter from the virtualenv, with any arguments forwarded.
- ``purge`` will uninstall all packages from the virtualenv.
- ``where`` will give location information about the current project. 
- ``venv`` will give virtutalenv activation information. 
- ``check`` asserts that PEP 508 requirements are being met by the current environment.
