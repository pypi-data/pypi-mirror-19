Pipenv: Sacred Marriage of Pipfile, Pip, & Virtualenv
=====================================================

Pipenv is an experimental project that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds to the Python world. It harnesses `Pipfile <https://github.com/pypa/pipfile>`_, pip, and virtualenv into one single toolchain. It features very pretty terminal colors.

It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your ``Pipfile`` as you install/uninstall packages. The ``lock`` command generates a lockfile (``Pipfile.lock``).

‚ò§ Features
----------

- Automatically finds your project home, recursively, by looking for a ``Pipfile``.
- Automatically generates a ``Pipfile``, if one doesn't exist.
- Automatically generates a ``Pipfile.lock``, if one doesn't exist.
- Automatically creates a virtualenv in a standard location (``project/.venv``).
- Automatically adds packages to a Pipfile when they are installed.
- Automatically removes packages from a Pipfile when they are un-installed.
- Also automatically updates pip.

The main commands are ```install``, ``uninstall``, and ``lock``, which generates a ``Pipfile.lock``. These are intended to replace ``$ pip install`` usage, as well as manual virtualenv management.

Basic Concepts
//////////////

- A virtualenv will automatically be created, when one doesn't exist.
- When no parameters are passed to ``install``, all packages specified will be installed.
- When no parameters are passed to ``uninstall``, all packages will be uninstalled.

Other Commands
//////////////

- ``shell`` will spawn a shell with the virtualenv activated.
- ``python`` will run the Python interpreter from the virtualenv, with any arguments forwarded.
- ``where`` will give location information about the current project.
- ``check`` asserts that PEP 508 requirements are being met by the current environment.

    To activate this project's virtualenv, run the following:
