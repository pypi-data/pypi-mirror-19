Description: pmacct-to-elasticsearch
        =======================
        
        **pmacct-to-elasticsearch** is a python script designed to read JSON output from **pmacct** daemons, to process it and to store it into **ElasticSearch**. It works with both *memory* and *print* plugins and, optionally, it can perform **manipulations on data** (such as to add fields on the basis of other values).

        1. **pmacct daemons** collect IP accounting data and process them with their plugins;
        2. data are stored into **in-memory-tables** (*memory* plugins) or **JSON files** (*print* plugins);
        3. **crontab jobs** (*memory* plugins) or **trigger scripts** (*print* plugins) are invoked to execute pmacct-to-elasticsearch;
        4. JSON records are finally processed by **pmacct-to-elasticsearch**, which reads them from stdin (*memory* plugins) or directly from JSON file.
        
        Optionally, some **data transformations** can be configured, to allow pmacct-to-elasticsearch to **add or remove fields** to/from the output documents that are sent to ElasticSearch for indexing. These additional fields may be useful to enhance graphs and reports legibility, or to add a further level of aggregation or filtering.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install the program using pip:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          pip install pmacct-to-elasticsearch
                
        Then clone the repository and run the ./install script to setup your system:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          cd /usr/local/src/
          git clone https://github.com/pierky/pmacct-to-elasticsearch.git
          cd pmacct-to-elasticsearch/
          ./install
          
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Please refer to the `CONFIGURATION.md`_ file. The `TRANSFORMATIONS.md`_ file contains details about data transformations configuration.

        A simple tutorial on pmacct integration with ElasticSearch/Kibana using pmacct-to-elasticsearch can be found at http://blog.pierky.com/integration-of-pmacct-with-elasticsearch-and-kibana.
        
        Future work
        -----------
        
        - Add support of more pmacct output formats (CSV, Apache Avro, ...).
        - Read input from stdin pipes too.
