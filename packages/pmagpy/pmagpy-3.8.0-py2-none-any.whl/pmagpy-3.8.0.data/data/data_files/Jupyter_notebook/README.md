Open and reproducible paleomagnetic data analysis using an IPython (Jupyter) notebook
================================

This repository contains an example IPython (Jupyter) notebook that was developed for the Tauxe et al., 2015 manuscript on the PmagPy project 

To run the code in the notebook it is necessary to both download the code from the Github repository and have an installed Python distribution that includes IPython and the other standard scientific python libraries (http://www.scipy.org/). If you followed the directions to install Enthought's Canopy Python distribution that are in the PmagPy cookbook (http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/), you have IPython installed. Just type `ipython notebook` in your command line or open up a notebook in Canopy. There are also good instructions for installing IPython/jupyter here: http://ipython.org/install.html. Alternatively you can view a static version of the notebook online with the Jupyter nbviewer at this link:
