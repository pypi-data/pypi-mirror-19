        **Make arbitrarily structured, arbitrary-dimension boxes.**
        
        `powerbox` is a pure-python code for creating density grids (or boxes) that have an arbitrary two-point distribution
        (i.e. power spectrum). Primary motivations for creating the code were the simple creation of lognormal mock galaxy
        distributions, but the methodology can be used for other applications.
        
        Features
        --------
        * Works in any number of dimensions.
        * Arbitrary isotropic power-spectra.
        * Option to transform density field to log-normal field.
        * Really simple.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        Clone/Download then ``python setup.py install``.
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        At this point, there's just a single class that is useful: `PowerBox`. You can import it like
        
        >>> from powerbox import PowerBox
        
        Once imported, to see all the options, just use `help`:
        
        >>> help(PowerBox)
        
        For a basic 2D Gaussian field with a power-law power-spectrum, one can use the following:
        
        >>> pb = PowerBox(N=512,  ## Number of grid-points in the box
                          dim=2,  ## 2D box
                          pk = lambda k: 0.1*k**-2., ## The power-spectrum
                          boxlength = 1.0 ## Size of the box (sets the units of k in pk)
                          )
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> plt.imshow(pb.delta_x)
        
        Other attributes of the box can be accessed also -- check them out with tab completion in an interpreter!
