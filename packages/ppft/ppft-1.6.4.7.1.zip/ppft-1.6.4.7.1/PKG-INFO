        About Ppft
        ==========
        
        ppft is a fork of Parallel Python, and is developed as part of pathos: https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos
        
        Parallel Python module (PP) provides an easy and efficient way to create parallel-enabled applications for SMP computers and clusters. PP module features cross-platform portability and dynamic load balancing. Thus application written with PP will parallelize efficiently even on heterogeneous and multi-platform clusters (including clusters running other application with variable CPU loads). Visit http://www.parallelpython.com for further information.
        
        Pathos is a python framework for heterogeneous computing.
        Pathos is in active development, so any user feedback, bug reports, comments,
        or suggestions are highly appreciated.  A list of known issues is maintained
        at http://trac.mystic.cacr.caltech.edu/project/pathos/query, with a public
        ticket list at https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos/issues.
        
        NOTE: ppft installs as pp. If pp is installed, it should be uninstalled before ppft is installed -- otherwise, "import pp" will likely not find the ppft fork.
        
        
        Major Changes:
        ==============
        
            - pip and setuptools support
            - support for python 3
            - enhanced serialization, using dill.source
        
        
        Current Release
        ===============
        
        This version is ppft-1.6.4.7.1 (a fork of pp-1.6.4).
        
        The latest released pathos fork of PP is available from::
        
            https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ppft
        
        PP is distributed under a BSD-like license.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Ppft is packaged to install from source, so you must
        download the tarball, unzip, and run the installer::
        
            [download]
            $ tar -xvzf ppft-1.6.4.7.1.tgz
            $ cd ppft-1.6.4.7.1
            $ python setup.py build
            $ python setup.py install
        
        You will be warned of any missing dependencies and/or settings
        after you run the "build" step above.
        
        Alternately, ppft can be installed with pip or easy_install::
        
            $ pip install ppft
        
        NOTE: ppft installs as pp. If pp is installed, it should be uninstalled before ppft is installed -- otherwise, "import pp" will likely not find the ppft fork.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Ppft requires::
        
            - python2, version >= 2.5  *or*  python3, version >= 3.1
            - six, version >= 1.7.3
        
        Optional requirements::
        
            - setuptools, version >= 0.6
            - dill, version >= 0.2.6
        
        
        More Information
        ================
        
        Probably the best way to get started is to look at the examples that are
        provided within PP.  See pp.examples for a set of scripts.  Please feel
        free to submit a ticket on github, or ask a question on stackoverflow
        (@Mike McKerns).
        
        Pathos is an active research tool. There are a growing number of publications
        and presentations that discuss real-world examples and new features of pathos
        in greater detail than presented in the user's guide.  If you would like to
        share how you use pathos in your work, please post a link or send an email
        (to mmckerns at uqfoundation dot org).
