Reinventing ticket presales, one bit at a time.

Project status
--------------
Most features are present and sufficiently stable. pretix has been in use for multiple event and
sold a few thousand tickets so far. There is still a bunch of features to come and there surely is
still a bunch of bugs in there, but we consider it stable enough that we use it in production ourselves.

If you deploy and use pretix, there will be a safe upgrade path for all changes to come. We're planning
on an 1.0 release in late 2016 or early 2017. Until then, we take the liberty of changing the code as we
like, but we try to keep the changes to documented APIs as small as possible. If you want to use pretix
in production or develop a plugin now, I invite you to send me an email so that I can notify you of changes
and bugs that require your attention.

Since very recently we now have an `installation guide`_ in our documentation.

Contributing
------------
If you want to contribute to pretix, please read the `developer documentation`_
in our documentation. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to ask!
