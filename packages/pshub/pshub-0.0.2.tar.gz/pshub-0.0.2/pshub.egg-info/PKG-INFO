Description: # pshub
        `pshub` is a lightweight Python framework that partially implements Publish/Subscribe messaging paradigm. 
        
        It utilizes `asyncio` library to support concurrent requests handling. The Python version that we recommend is 3.5+ .
        
        ## Name
        
        The name `pshub` indicates the three main components of this library â€” Pub, Sub and Hub.
        
        ## Usage
        
        You can refer to the three example files under directory `examples/`.
        
        ## Cheatsheet
        
        ### Rule
        
        #### Example
        
        `{"level": {">=": 1, "<": 10}, "message_body": {"contains": "ERROR"}}`
        
        #### Valid Operators
        
        - `contains`
        - `<`
        - `<=`
        - `>`
        - `>=`
        - `=`
        - `!=`
        - `excludes`
        
        ### Message
        
        #### Example
        
        `{"level": 2, "message_body": "ERROR occurs"}`
        
        ## Caveats
        
        - All messages/rules should be Python `dict` whose keys and values are primitive Python type (int, string, etc.)
        
        - The second parameter of the constructor of `PubProtocol`, `msg_gen`, should has following method:
        
        ```python
        class MessageGenerator(object):
            def next(self, loop):
                """
                Return next message 
                
                Stop the loop if there's no message to publish.
                """
                pass
        ```
