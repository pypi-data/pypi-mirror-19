To learn more about Pushover and the Pushover API, please visit the Pushover Website, `<https://pushover.net>`_.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from pushover_complete import PushoverAPI
   >>> p = PushoverAPI('azGDORePK8gMaC0QOYAMyEEuzJnyUi')  # an instance of the PushoverAPI representing your application
   >>> p.send_message('uQiRzpo4DXghDmr9QzzfQu27cmVRsG', 'Your toast is finished.')  # send a message to a user

That's all you need to get started with sending Pushover notifications from your Python program.
The majority of Pushover's API endpoints are accessible via :code:`pushover_complete`.
Check out the `docs <http://pushover-complete.readthedocs.io/>`_ to learn more.

Installation
------------

Installation should be as easy as executing this command in your chosen terminal:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install pushover_complete

:code:`pushover_complete` officially supports Python 2.7 and 3.5.
Currently, Python 3.3 and 3.4 pass all tests and function properly as well, but this could change: these versions are not officially targeted by development.
Support for Python 2.x may be dropped in the future, but only in a major version update (e.g. 1.x.y â†’ 2.x.y) and this change will be announced well in advance.

Changelog
---------

Changes as of 23 December 2016

1.0.2 <23 December 2016>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- "Add" Python 3.6 support. It's not in Travis as an allowed failure and didn't require any code changes to pass!
- Fix a major bug with the receipt cancel API. I was using a `GET` request instead of a `POST`
- Stop using the `releases` Sphinx plugin for the changelog. Its philosophy didn't match well with mine
- Update release procedure based on no longer using `releases`
- Some minor documentation fixes

1.0.1 <10 May 2016>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Officially add Python 2.7 support and add testing for it to tox and Travis
- Numerous updates to documentation and README, etc. to make them prettier and more useful

1.0.0 <9 May 2016>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Implementation of methods for the Pushover messages, sounds, users, receipt, subscriptions, groups, and licenses APIs
- Documentation and build process
