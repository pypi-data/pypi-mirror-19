Yeah it was...REALLY stupid!

Introduction
------------

This project is dumb. It's really dumb. And, that's a good thing.

This project provides a dummy package that can be used in testing. It has
really worthless and limited functionality, but it has thorough documentation
and testing and all the good stuff you would expect to find in a full-fledged
python package.

Installing
==========
Install using pip::

$ pip install py-dummy
