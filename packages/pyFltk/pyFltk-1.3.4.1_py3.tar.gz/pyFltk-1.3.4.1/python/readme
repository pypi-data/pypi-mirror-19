How to compile the project (for developers):

Let us denote the root directory of the pyFltk distribution as $PYFLTK. This is the directory where you downloaded the CVs version to.

1) Run python MakeSwig.py in the directory $PYFLTK/python. This will run SWIG 
on the interface files and create the actual wrapper code. In general fltk 
will be searched for on the path. If you want to override the default 
installation of fltk, then you have to set the environment variable FLTK_HOME 
to do so. This is also advisable if you are using MinGW.

2) Change to the root directory of the pyfltk distribution $PYFLTK and run 
python setup.py build and/or python setup.py install. This will compile and 
install the python wrapper and the dll. For MinGW32 you have to run 
python setup.py build -cmingw32 install instead.

That's all! This has been tested and designed for Linux and Windows with 
MinGW. With another OS your mileage might vary.

Requirements: swig-1.3.30 or later (for Python 2.5)
