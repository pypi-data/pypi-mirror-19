   * When constructing messages from one clique to its neighbor, we can
   * determine that some nodes are barren, i.e., they are the only one
   * at the left hand side of a conditioning bar and they appear in only one
   * potential. In such case, in a classical BN inference, there is no need
   * to take them into account since their removal will necessarily create
   * a constant potential. So, we can discard their potential from the
   * computation. However, when computing p(evidence), we should not do that
   * because the constant is important and need be computed.

   * @class BayesNetInference inference.h
   * <agrum/BN/inference/BayesNetInference.h>
   * @brief A generic class for Bayes net inference: handles evidence and the
   * current state of the (incremental) inference
   * @ingroup bn_group
   *
   * The goal of the BayesNetInference class is twofold:
   * i) handling the common resources of BN inference (bn, soft/hard evidence);
   * ii) propose a general high-level scheme for all the inference methods.
   *
   * A specialized inference just has to specify how to prepare inference, how
   * to make inference and how to get the posteriors for nodes and set of nodes.
   * The scheme for every inference derived from BayesNetInference will be
   * the same:
   *
   * 1- ie=SpecificInference(bn);              // state <- OutdatedBNStructure
   * 2- set targets and evidence in ie
   * 3- ie.prepareInference();                 // state <- Ready4Inference
   * 4.a- change values of evidence in ie      // state <- OutdatedBNPotentials
   * 4.b- change some hard evidence or targets // state <- OutdatedBNStructure
   * 5- ie.makeInference();                    // state <- Done
   * 6- get posteriors
   * 7- goto 2 or 4
   *
   * BayesNetInference can be in one of 4 different states:
   * - OutdatedBNStructure: in this state, the inference is fully unprepared
   *   to be applied because some events changed the "logical" structure of the
   *   BN: for instance a node received a hard evidence, which implies that
   *   its outgoing arcs can be removed from the BN, hence involving a
   *   structural change in the BN. As a consequence, the (incremental)
   *   inference
   *   (probably) needs a significant amount of preparation to be ready for the
   *   next inference. In a Lazy propagation, for instance, this step amounts to
   *   compute a new join tree, hence a new structure in which inference
   *   will be applied. Note that classes that inherit from BayesNetInference
   *   may be smarter than BayesNetInference and may, in some situations,
   *   find out that their
   *   data structures are still ok for inference and, therefore, only resort to
   *   perform the actions related to the OutdatedBNPotentials state. As an
   *   example, consider a LazyPropagation inference in Bayes Net A->B->C->D->E
   *   in which C has received hard evidence e_C and E is the only target. In
   *   this case, A and B are not needed for inference, the only potentials that
   *   matter are P(D|e_C) and P(E|D). So the smallest join tree needed for
   *   inference contains only one clique DE. Now, adding new evidence e_A on A
   *   has no impact on E given hard evidence e_C. In this case, LazyPropagation
   *   can be smart and not update its join tree.
   * - OutdatedBNPotentials: in this state, the structure of the BN remains
   *   unchanged, only some potentials stored in it have changed. Therefore,
   *   the inference probably just needs to invalidate some already computed
   *   potentials to be ready. Only a light amount of preparation is needed to
   *   be able to perform inference.
   * - Ready4Inference: in this state, all the data structures are ready for
   *   inference. There just remains to perform the inference computations.
   * - Done: the heavy computations of inference have been done. There might
   *   still remain a few light computations to perform to get the posterior
   *   potentials we need. Typically, in Lazy Propagation, all the messages in
   *   the join tree have been computed but, to get the potentials, we still
   *   need to perform the combinations of the potentials in the cliques with
   *   the messages sent to the cliques. In some inference algorithms, this
   *   step may even be empty.

     * data structures are still ok for inference and, therefore, only resort to

     * in which C has received hard evidence e_C and E is the only target. In
     * this case, A and B are not needed for inference, the only potentials that
     * matter are P(D|e_C) and P(E|D). So the smallest join tree needed for
     * inference contains only one clique DE. Now, adding new evidence e_A on A
     * has no impact on E given hard evidence e_C. In this case, LazyPropagation
     * can be smart and not update its join tree.*/
