/** @file
 * @brief Base Class for all elimination sequence algorithms that require only
 * the graph to be triangulated and the nodes' domain sizes to produce the node
 * elimination ordering.
 *
 * In many cases, the graph to be triangulated and the nodes domain sizes are
 * the only information needed to compute an elimination ordering. For instance,
 * this is only what is needed for computing junction trees for Bayesian
 * networks or GAI networks. For such cases, the elimination sequence algorithms
 * derived from UnconstrainedEliminationSequenceStrategy are appropriate. There
 * are however other cases in which additional informations must be passed to
 * the elimination sequence algorithm to produce a correct elimination ordering.
 * For instance, computing a strong junction tree for an influence diagram
 * requires the knowledge of a partial ordering on the nodes to be eliminated.
 * For such cases, classes derived from UnconstrainedEliminationSequenceStrategy
 * are not appropriate and those should be derived from other elimination
 * sequence
 * factories, for from instance PartialOrderedEliminationSequenceStrategy.
