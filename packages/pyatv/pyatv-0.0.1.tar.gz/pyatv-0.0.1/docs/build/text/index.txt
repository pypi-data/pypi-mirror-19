pyatv: Apple TV Remote Control Library
**************************************


Features
========

* Automatic discovery of devices (zeroconf/Bonjour)

* Most buttons (play, pause, next, previous, select, menu, topmenu)

* Fetch artwork in PNG format

* Currently playing (e.g. title, artist, album, total time, etc.)

* Change media position


Library Installation
====================

Use pip:

   $ pip install pyatv


Getting Started
===============

Connecting to the first automatically discovered device:

   import asyncio
   from pyatv import helpers

   @asyncio.coroutine
   def print_what_is_playing(atv):
       playing = yield from atv.metadata.playing()
       print('Currently playing:')
       print(playing)

   helpers.auto_connect(print_what_is_playing)

Connecting to a specific device:

   import pyatv
   import asyncio

   NAME = 'My Apple TV'
   ADDRESS = '10.0.10.22'
   HSGID = '00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444'
   DETAILS = pyatv.AppleTVDevice(NAME, ADDRESS, HSGID)


   @asyncio.coroutine
   def print_what_is_playing(loop, details):
       print('Connecting to {}'.format(details.address))
       atv = pyatv.connect_to_apple_tv(details, loop)

       try:
           playing = yield from atv.metadata.playing()
           print('Currently playing:')
           print(playing)
       except:
           yield from atv.logout()


   loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
   loop.run_until_complete(print_what_is_playing(loop, DETAILS))

TODO: Explain how to get HSGID.
