    Creates an alias for a fleet. You can use an alias to anonymize your fleet by referencing an alias instead of a specific fleet when you create game sessions. Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. Use a simple alias to point to an active fleet. Use a terminal alias to display a message to incoming traffic instead of routing players to an active fleet. This option is useful when a game server is no longer supported but you want to provide better messaging than a standard 404 error.
    To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID, which you can reference when creating a game session. To reassign the alias to another fleet ID, call  UpdateAlias .
