        *Resolve Configurations from Abstract Hierarchies and Templates*
        
        Managing configuration is hard. You sometimes need simplicity, like a
        few key-value properties. Sometimes you need more than a few, and you
        realize that a lot of your key names and values are similar and you wish
        you could share and reuse them.
        
        Wouldn't it be great to define conf in a hierarchical fashion and then
        have a logic engine spit out the resolved configuration? This is
        **converge**. Abstract hierarchies of data chewed up and spit out to
        simple key-values to your liking.
        
        How it works
        ============
        
        Getting started
        ===============
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        A Brief History of Pain
        =======================
        
        You may have hit some (or all, like me) of these stages in the persuit
        of configurability:
        
        *In short: from the file, to the GUI, back to the file you idiot.* \*
        Externalizing configuration from your applications, to avoid re-releases
        due to simple conf tuning \* Realizing that you're now managing a
        million de-centralized files with no similar structure \* Create or use
        a centralized, GUI/DB based confguration management system (woohoo!
        configuration liberation!) \* Realizing that automating without a
        middleman is both simpler and more efficient, and that you never should
        have used a GUI/DB. Files we always the solution, just a different kind
        of file, where they are in a non resolved state from which you can
        generate an output that meets your needs.
        
        Files are best because: \* you can use time tested versioning systems
        like git or mercurial to branch, release, rollback, check history \* you
        can automate the modification of files with any tool you want \* doing
        migrations on DB values/REST endpoints sucks (because it's unecessarily
        complex)
