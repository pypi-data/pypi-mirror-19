==========

See <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pycroscopy/> for more info.

0. Description
--------------
A python package for image processing and scientific analysis of imaging modalities such as multi-frequency scanning probe microscopy,
scanning tunneling spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.
Classes implemented here are ported to a high performance computing platform at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

1. Package Structure
--------------------
The package structure is simple, with 4 main modules:
   1. `io`: Input/Output from custom & proprietary microscope formats to HDF5.
   2. `processing`: Multivariate Statistics, Machine Learning, and Filtering.
   3. `analysis`: Model-dependent analysis of image information.
   4. `viz`: Visualization and interactive slicing of high-dimensional data by lightweight Qt viewers.

Once a user converts their microscope's data format into an HDF5 format, by simply extending some of the classes in `io`, the user gains access to the rest of the utilities present in `pycroscopy.*`. 

2. Installation
---------------
Pycroscopy requires the installation of the base python libraries, a C compiler, and preferrably - a development environment such as Spyder from Continuum or PyCharm. 

   1. Install Anaconda 2.5.0 Python 2.7 64-bit:

      a. Mac users: <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-2.5.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg>

      b. Windows users: <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-2.5.0-Windows-x86_64.exe>

      c. Linux users: <https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-2.5.0-Linux-x86_64.sh>

   2. Install a C compiler - Windows users ONLY:
      
      If you are running on a Windows machine, you will need to load a C compiler, which is required to build certain packages in python including one for parallel processing. Mac Users can skip this step as OS X natively comes with a C compiler.
      
      a. Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x64) from <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=2092>

      b. Install Microsoft Visual C++ for Python from <http://aka.ms/vcpython27>

   3. Install multiprocess for parallel computation tasks

      Open a terminal (mac / linux) or command prompt (windows) and type:

         pip install multiprocess

   4. Install pycroscopy:

      Open a terminal (mac / linux) or command prompt (windows) and type:

         pip install pycroscopy

   5. Enjoy pycroscopy!
