.SH NAME
diff_map \- Azimuthal integration for diffraction imaging
.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: diff_map [options] \fB\-p\fR ponifile imagefiles*
If the number of files is too large, use double quotes like "*.edf"
.PP
Azimuthal integration for diffraction imaging. Diffraction mapping is an
experiment where 2D diffraction patterns are recorded while performing a 2D
scan. Diff_map is a graphical application (based on pyFAI and h5py) which
allows the reduction of this 4D dataset into a 3D dataset containing the two
motion dimensions and the many diffraction angles (thousands). The resulting
dataset can be opened using PyMca roitool where the 1d dataset has to be
selected as last dimension. This result file aims at being NeXus compliant.
This tool can be used for diffraction tomography experiment as well,
considering the slow scan direction as the rotation.

Bugs: Many, see hereafter: 1)If the number of files is too large, use double
quotes "*.edf" 2)There is a known bug on Debian7 where importing a large
number of file can take much longer than the integration itself: consider
passing files in the command line
