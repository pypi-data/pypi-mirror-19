.SH NAME
pyFAI-average \- Image preprocessing tool
.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: pyFAI\-average [options] [options] \fB\-o\fR output.edf file1.edf file2.edf ...
.PP
This tool can be used to average out a set of dark current images using mean
or median filter (along the image stack). One can also reject outliers be
specifying a cutoff (remove cosmic rays / zingers from dark)

\fB\-m\fR METHOD, \fB\-\-method\fR METHOD
Method used for averaging, can be 'mean' (default) or
\&'min', 'max', 'median', 'sum', 'quantiles' , 'cutoff',
\&'std'. Multiple filters can be defined with ','
separator.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR CUTOFF, \fB\-\-cutoff\fR CUTOFF
Take the mean of the average +/\- cutoff * std_dev.

Dark noise to be subtracted

Flat field correction

switch to verbose/debug mode
.TP
\fB\-q\fR QUANTILES, \fB\-\-quantiles\fR QUANTILES
average out between two quantiles \fB\-q\fR 0.20\-0.90
.TP
\fB\-\-monitor\-name\fR MONITOR_KEY
Name of the monitor in the header of each input files.
If defined the contribution of each input file is
divided by the monitor. If the header does not contain
or contains a wrong value, the contribution of the
input file is ignored. On EDF files, values from
\&'counter_pos' can accessed by using the expected
mnemonic. For example 'counter/bmon'.
.TP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
Only error messages are printed out
.PP
It can also be used to merge many images from the same sample when using a
small beam and reduce the spotty\-ness of Debye\-Sherrer rings. In this case the
"max\-filter" is usually recommended.
