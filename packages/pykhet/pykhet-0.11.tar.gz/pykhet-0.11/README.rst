Introduction
------------

The Khet board game logic and structures implemented in python. Also exposes adversarial search based algorithms.

.. code-block:: python

    from pykhet.components.types import TeamColor
    from pykhet.games.game_types import ClassicGame
    import random
    from pykhet.solvers.minmax import MinmaxSolver

    # Create a game with classic piece placement
    game = ClassicGame()

    # Get all valid silver moves
    silver_moves = game.get_available_moves(TeamColor.silver)

    # Randomly Play One
    game.apply_move(random.choice(silver_moves))

    # Finish the turn by applying the laser
    game.apply_laser(TeamColor.silver)

    # Use adversarial search to pick a move
    solver = MinmaxSolver()
    move = solver.get_move(game, TeamColor.red)
    game.apply_move(move)
    game.apply_laser(TeamColor.red)


Board Layout

The khet board and piece layout is represented below:

Adversarial Search
------------------

Provided is a very basic adversarial search algorithm that works with a low number of iterations.
