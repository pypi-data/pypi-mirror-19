# This file is an example of the permissions system in PyLink. Should you wish,
# you may copy the contents of this file and paste it into the configuration you're
# using.
# Permissions work by mapping hostmasks or exttargets to list of permissions, allowing
# you to fine tune which users have access to which commands.

# The permissions API is new, and optional for plugins. Currently, only Automode uses it.

# If you do not specify any permissions block in your configuration, PyLink will default to a
# permission set defined by plugins, which usually correspond to the list below, but can be
# changed on every release.

# This determines whether we should merge the plugin-default permissions with the ones specified
# in the permissions: block. Disabling this allows you greater control over the permissions
# PyLink gives, but you should check this file on every major update to see if any new permissions
# were added for commands. Otherwise, commands that were available before may cease to function!
