Description: 
        Pylm
        ====
        
        Pylm is the Python implementation of PALM, a framework to build
        clusters of high performance components. Pylm-registry provides
        a set of tools to launch and monitor PALM clusters.
        
        **Pylm requires a version of Python equal or higher than 3.4, and it is
        more thoroughly tested with Python 3.5.**
        
        Installing **pylm** is as easy as:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $> pip install pylm-registry
