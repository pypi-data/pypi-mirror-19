A (sparse) matrix solver for python.

Solving Ax = b should be as easy as:

.. code-block:: python

    Ainv = Solver(A)
    x = Ainv * b

In pymatsolver I provide a number of wrappers to existing numerical packages. Nothing fancy here.

Solvers Available
=================

All solvers work with :code:`scipy.sparse` matricies, and a single or multiple right hand sides using :code:`numpy`:

* L/U Triangular Solves
* Wrapping of SciPy matrix solvers (direct and indirect)
* Pardiso solvers now that MKL comes with conda!
* Mumps solver with nice error messages


Installing Mumps
================

I have not been able to get the pip install to work because of multiple dependencies on fortran libraries.
However, the linux and mac installs are relatively easy. Note that you must have mumps pre-installed,
currently I have only got this working for the sequential version, so when you are installing,
you will need to point to that one. You can also look at the `.travis.yml` file for how to get it working on TravisCI.

Linux
-----

>From a clean install on Ubuntu:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get update
    apt-get -y install gcc gfortran git libopenmpi-dev libmumps-seq-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev

    # Install all the python you need!
    wget http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-3.8.3-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh;
    chmod +x miniconda.sh
    ./miniconda.sh -b
    export PATH=/root/anaconda/bin:/root/miniconda/bin:$PATH
    conda update --yes conda
    conda install --yes numpy scipy matplotlib cython ipython nose

    git clone https://github.com/rowanc1/pymatsolver.git
    cd pymatsolver
    make mumps

Mac
---

This assumes that you have Brew and some python installed (numpy, scipy):

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install mumps --with-scotch5 --without-mpi

    git clone https://github.com/rowanc1/pymatsolver.git
    cd pymatsolver
    make mumps_mac

If you have problems you may have to go into the Makefile and update the pointers to Lib and Include for the various libraries.

This command is helpful for finding dependencies. You should also take note of have happens when brew installs mumps.

.. code-block:: bash

    mpicc --showme
