# B64 {: .doctitle}
Images to base64.

---

## Overview
In the current iteration, B64 allows for embedding images with base64 encoding.  It simply needs a base path to resolve relative links, and it will embed the images as base64 resources.  This is useful if you would like to distribute a Markdown output without having to also distribute the images separately.  In a normal website, this would probably not be desired.

## Options

| Option    | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| base_path | string | '' | A string indicating a base path to be used to resolve relative links. |
