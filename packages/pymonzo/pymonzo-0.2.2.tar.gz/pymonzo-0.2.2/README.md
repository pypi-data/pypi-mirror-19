An - dare I say it - awesome Python library that smartly wraps [Monzo][monzo]
public API and allows you to use it directly in your Python project.

It creates a layer of abstraction and returns Python objects instead of just
passing the received JSONs. It also deals with authentication and allows using
either an access token or fully authenticate via OAuth 2 that's a PITA to set
up but is then automatically refreshed in the background. Yeah, you read it
correctly - no more manual changing of the access token every couple of hours.
High five!

## Installation
From PyPI:
```
$ pip install pymonzo
```

## Authentication

### Access token
If you want to just play around then you can simply get the access token taken
from [Monzo API Playground][monzo api playground], either pass it explicitly to
`MonzoAPI()` class or save it as an environment variable
(`$ export MONZO_ACCESS_TOKEN='...'`) and you're good to go. Everything works
as expected _but_ the token is valid only for couple of hours.

### OAuth 2
The second authentication option is to go through OAuth 2, which doesn't sound
bad (everyone is using it!) but from my experience is a PITA when setting up
for server side applications. So.

Some technical background: Monzo currently only allows OAuth 2 'authorization 
code' grant type and automatic token refreshing is only allowed for
'confidential' clients.

First, you need to create said client [here][monzo api client]. Name and logo
don't really matter but you need to set the redirect URL to this repo
(`https://github.com/pawelad/pymonzo`) and set it to be confidential.

Got it? Cool. You now have required 'Client ID' and 'Client secret' and only
need the auth code. You get it by creating a link with your client ID:  
```
https://auth.getmondo.co.uk/?client_id=$ClientID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://github.com/pawelad/pymonzo
```

You then go to the link and authorise the app. You should get an email with a
link back to the GitHub repo and the authorization code, something like:
```
https://github.com/pawelad/pymonzo?code=$AuthCode
```

You now have all three needed values - client ID, client secret and the auth
code. As with the access token, you can either pass them directly to
`MonzoAPI()` class or save them as environment variables:
```
$ export MONZO_CLIENT_ID='...'
$ export MONZO_CLIENT_SECRET='...'
$ export MONZO_AUTH_CODE='...'
```

That's it! The token is then saved on the disk (`~/.pymonzo`) and is
automatically refreshed when needed, so all this (_should_) be one time only.

## Roadmap
The library currently doesn't implement feed items, webhooks and attachments
endpoints, mostly because they were't essential to my current needs
([monz][monz]) and they could be completely different in the future - per
[Monzo docs][monzo docs introduction]:
> The Monzo API is under active development. Breaking changes should be expected.

That said, if you need one of those endpoints feel free to either create a PR
that add them or let me know that you want them and I'll see what I can do : -)

## API
There's no proper documentation as of now, but the code is commented and
*should* be pretty straightforward to use.

But feel free to ask me via [email](mailto:pawel.ad@gmail.com) or 
[GitHub issues][github add issue] if anything is unclear.

## Tests
Package was tested with the help of `py.test` and `tox` on Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5
and 3.6 (see `tox.ini`).

Code coverage is available at [Coveralls][coveralls].

To run tests yourself you need to set environment variables with access token
before running `tox` inside the repository:
```shell
$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
$ export MONZO_ACCESS_TOKEN='...'
$ tox
```

## Contributions
Package source code is available at [GitHub][github].
