========
nYNABapi
========

a python client for the new YNAB API

Installation
------------

download the source, then call `python setup.py install`

Usage
-----

Either code your own script that uses the pynYNAB api, or use the provided scripts, ofximport, YNAB4 migrate, csvimport

Scripts Documentation
---------------------

see appropriate `README`_

API Documentation
-----------------

nYNAB is organised around a root object, here it is a nYnabClient object. It is created by giving it a connection object,
which handles the requests to the server (app.youneedabudget.com and its api endpoint /api/v1/catalog),
using the same commands that the Javascript app at app.youneedabudget.com uses internally.

The connection object needs email and password for the nYNAB account

Once you have created your nYnabClient object, all data should have already been synced up with YNAB's servers. If you
need fresh data, call reload on the nYnabClient.

All the entity handling is done through the Budget and Catalog objects, they contain collections such
as be_accounts, be_transactions, ce_user_settings, etc. Look into the budget/catalog for the schema.

In order to write some data to YNAB servers for your budget, you just need to modify a collection in those Budget/Catalog 
objects then call nYnabobject.sync. To append a new entity, delete or modify an existing one, call the appropriate
methods on a collection inside the budget or catalog objects.
    
I've provided some tested methods e.g. add_account, add_transaction, in the nYnabClient class to
add/delete accounts and transactions as examples. Some actions are not always simple (e.g., to add an account, 
you need to add a transfer payee, a starting balance transaction, otherwise the server refuses the request). You're welcome 
to contribute new actions e.g. by catching the requests done in the UI with Fiddler to see what's done.

Caution with add_transaction, it works even for large amount of transactions (tested up to 3000), but please 
don't stress test the YNAB servers with it... 

YNAB implemented throttling on their API, and pynYNAB honors it, by 
catching the error id request_throttled and waiting the time specified in the Retry-After header by the server.

Approach of preventing Harm  
---------------------------

I've taken all precautionary steps so that this python Client can't affect YNAB even if used too widely. 
* It honors requests by the server to throttle its requests  >  Same mechanisme that the JS app uses
* It self-limits the requests to 5 request per second 
* It clearly identifies itself by User-Agent > Easy to lock it out if it causes trouble
