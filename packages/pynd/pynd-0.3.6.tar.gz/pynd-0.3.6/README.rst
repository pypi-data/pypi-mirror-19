pynd - Search Python Abstract Tree
==================================

pynd is a command line utility for searching the Python abstract tree to easily
find what you are looking for. It is a bit like using grep, but it understands
Python syntax and structure. This means you can search for classes, functions or
just within docstrings without relying on regular expressions.
