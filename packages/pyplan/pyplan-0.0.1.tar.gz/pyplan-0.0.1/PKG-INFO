Description: pyplan
        ======
        
        The pyplan project is being developed to provide tools for
        planning-level alternative analysis of progresive capital improvement
        projects. pyplan is well suited to illustrate the cost/benefit dynamics
        of projects made up of several independent and combinable sub-projects.
        
        Example use case:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        A utility is interested in addresing a regional flooding issue with new
        releif sewers. Relief sewers are being considered in three different
        areas, each of which may be implemented at 1, 2, or 3 mile lengths. The
        relief sewers in each area can be combined with relief sewers in the
        other two areas, regardless of how long any reach is.
        
        Engineers then produce cost estimates and measure the performance of
        every logical combination of flood releif sewer installation. (The
        `swmmio`_ package is being developed to generate flood releif models
        with EPA SWMMM5 for this exact use case). With cost benefit data
        available for every incremental flood relief sewer phase, pyplan can
        find the most efficient implementation paths:
