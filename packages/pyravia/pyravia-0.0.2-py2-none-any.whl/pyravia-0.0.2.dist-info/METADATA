Library to control Sony TVs and Stereos

Sony makes excellent TVs and Stereos, but like old-school yutzes
does not publish the API to control them. (something something official
integration partners something something corruption something something)

That's ok though - since all of the network interactions are done in clear
text over the network, making them pretty easy to figure out.

Making it all even better, there is a different API for the TV than for the
Stereo. YAY!
