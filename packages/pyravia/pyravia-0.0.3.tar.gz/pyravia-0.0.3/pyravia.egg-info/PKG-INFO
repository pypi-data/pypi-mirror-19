        Library to control Sony TVs and Stereos
        
        Sony makes excellent TVs and Stereos, but like old-school yutzes
        does not publish the API to control them. (something something official
        integration partners something something corruption something something)
        
        That's ok though - since all of the network interactions are done in clear
        text over the network, making them pretty easy to figure out.
        
        Making it all even better, there is a different API for the TV than for the
        Stereo. YAY!
        
        This has been tested against a XBR75X850D TV and a STR-ZA5000ES receiver.
