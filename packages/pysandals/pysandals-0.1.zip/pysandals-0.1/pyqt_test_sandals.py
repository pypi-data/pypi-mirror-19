class ImgDiffer:
    """
    Default class used by check_widget_snapshot in order to measure whether two images are sufficiently 
    similar to be considered as identical. The images are assumed to come from QWidget.grab(), so the 
    differences measured are simple: 
    
    - if two images are identical, get_img_diff(image1, image2) returns None
    - if the two images differ beyond specified tolerances, get_img_diff(image1, image2) returns a QImage 
      instance that contains the differences between the two images. Each pixel that is the same in both 
      images is black in the diff image, and each pixel that is different is the absolute difference between 
      the two pixels. So a pixel that is black in image1 and white in image2, or vice versa, will show up 
      as a white pixel in the diff image. 
      
    This class computes the RMS difference between pixels averaged over the number of different pixels, 
    the percentage of pixels that are different, and the largest difference between two channels. 
    The following situations are covered: 
    
    - images where most pixels differ by a small amount, and other pixels are identical: large percentage 
      of pixels are different, but by a small RMS amount
    - images where very few pixels differ, but they differ by a lot: small percentage of pixels are different,
      but by a large RMS amount
    - a mixture of the two: RMS could be small if lots of pixels changed by a small amount and a few pixels 
      changed by a large amount (for example, if a label changed text, like an "i" for an "l"), but max change 
      will be large.
      
    If a diff is executed on the same platform all the time, the differ should probably have 0 tolerance 
    (any change is likely a regression). But if a diff is executed on several machines, small differences 
    could be visible due to anti-aliasing effects so they do not represent a true difference. In this case
    the 3 tolerances should be non-zero but small.
