# python-dispatch
Lightweight event handling for Python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nocarryr/python-dispatch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nocarryr/python-dispatch)[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/nocarryr/python-dispatch/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/nocarryr/python-dispatch?branch=master)

## Description
This is an implementation of the "Observer Pattern" with inspiration from the
[Kivy](kivy.org) framework. Many of the features though are intentionally
stripped down and more generalized. The goal is to have a simple drop-in
library with no dependencies that stays out of the programmer's way.

## Installation
```
pip install python-dispatch
```
