Description
-----------

This is an implementation of the "Observer Pattern" with inspiration
from the `Kivy <kivy.org>`_ framework. Many of the features though are
intentionally stripped down and more generalized. The goal is to have a
simple drop-in library with no dependencies that stays out of the
programmer's way.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install python-dispatch
