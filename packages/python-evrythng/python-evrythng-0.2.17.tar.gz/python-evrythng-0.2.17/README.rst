Notice
------

This project is currently in heavy development. We are creating a rough basic
entity API first. Then we will iterate off of that and refactor commonalities
into something worth using.

Though mostly usable, it hasn't reached a production build. Also, things are
pretty naive at the moment... much refactoring needs to take place.

TODO
----

- Complete datatype_list_of_social_networks validation.
- Implement Service APIs.
- Alias endpoints
    - /products/:productId/actions/:actionType
    - /thngs/:thngId/actions/:actionType
    - /collections/:collectionId/actions/:actionType
- 'to' parameter in delete_location
