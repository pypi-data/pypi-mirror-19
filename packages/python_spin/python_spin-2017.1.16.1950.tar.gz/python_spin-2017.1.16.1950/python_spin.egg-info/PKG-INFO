Description: spin
        ====
        
        a small utility to assist in setting usage modes of laptop-tablet
        devices
        
        setup
        -----
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo apt-get -y install python-qt4
            sudo pip install python_spin
        
        quick start
        -----------
        
        This utility can be run in its default graphical mode or in a
        non-graphical mode. The graphical mode is engaged by running
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            spin.py
        
        while the non-graphical mode is engaged by using the option ``--nogui``:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            spin.py --nogui
        
        By default, this utility disables the touchscreen on detecting the
        stylus in proximity and it changes between the laptop and tablet modes
        on detecting toggling between the laptop and tablet usage
        configurations. These default behaviours are provided by both the
        graphical and non-graphical modes of this utility. This utility should
        be initiated in the laptop usage configuration.
        
        compatibility
        -------------
        
        This utility has been tested on the following operating systems:
        
        -  Ubuntu 14.10
        -  Ubuntu 15.04
        -  Ubuntu 16.10
        
        This utility has been tested on the following computer models:
        
        -  ThinkPad S1 Yoga
        -  ThinkPad S120 Yoga
        
        There is evidence that it does not run with full functionality on the
        ThinkPad Yoga 14.
        
        acceleration control
        --------------------
        
        There is an experimental acceleration control included which is
        deactivated by default. It can be activated by selecting the appropriate
        button in the graphical mode.
        
        future
        ------
        
        Under consideration is state recording in order to avoid execution of
        unnecessary commands, better handling of subprocesses, clearer logging
        and a more ergonomic graphical mode.
