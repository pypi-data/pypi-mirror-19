Description: The Repository Supervisor
        =========================
        
        version number: 0.0.1 author: Gavin Cooper
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        A tool for supervising multiple repositories, checking their status and
        providing regular reminders of unfinished work.
        
        Who is it for
        =============
        
        This tool is primarily designed for those developers or repository users
        who may have multiple (read 10+) repositories all possibly being touched
        during a day. It's main benefit will be providing a regular report of
        repositories that are in an uncomitted/unpushed or unpulled state,
        allowing you to write your commit messages and push your local changes
        whilst the work is still fresh in your mind.
        
        Installation / Usage
        ====================
        
        To install use pip:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install repovisor
        
        Or clone the repository:
        
        ::
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/gjc216/repovisor.git
            $ python setup.py install
        
        As a manually run script, or added as a cron job it will provide a
        status for all repositories in it's internal database, showing the
        results either within a terminal, or as a web generated report
