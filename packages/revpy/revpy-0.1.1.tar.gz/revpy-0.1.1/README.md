[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flix-tech/RevPy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flix-tech/RevPy)

Collection of some revenue management tools for Python 3. 

## Features

- Single leg optimizer (EMSRb)
- Fare transformation for unrestricted fare structures
- EMSRb for unrestricted fare structures (EMSRb-MR)
- A multi-flight recapture method (MFRM) for estimating unconstrained demand from sales transaction data

## TODO
 - Leg bid price calculator for networks using deterministic LP method
 - Based on this, implementation of DAVN
