A library of scalable Bayesian generalized linear models with *fancy* features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*revrand* is a python (2 and 3) **supervised machine learning** library that
contains implementations of various Bayesian linear and generalized linear
models (i.e. Bayesian linear regression and Bayesian generalized linear
regression). 

*revrand* can be used for **large scale approximate Gaussian process
regression**, like `GPflow <https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow>`_ and `GPy
<https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy>`_, but it uses random basis kernel
approximations (see [1]_, [2]_, [3]_) as opposed to inducing point
approximations.

A few features of this library are:

- Random Basis functions that can be used to approximate Gaussian processes
  with shift invariant covariance functions (e.g. Matern) when used with linear
  models [1]_, [2]_, [3]_.
- A fancy basis functions/feature composition framework for combining basis
  functions like those above and radial basis functions, sigmoidal basis
  functions, polynomial basis functions etc *with basis function parameter
  learning*.
- Non-Gaussian likelihoods with Bayesian generalized linear models (GLMs). We
  infer all of the parameters in the GLMs using stochastic variational 
  inference [4]_, and we approximate the posterior over the weights with a
  mixture of Gaussians, like [5]_.
- Large scale learning using stochastic gradients (Adam, AdaDelta and more).
- Scikit Learn compatibility, i.e. usable with `pipelines
  <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/pipeline.html>`_.
- A host of decorators for `scipy.optimize.minimize
  <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html>`_ and stochastic 
  gradients that enhance the functionality of these optimisers.

Here is an example of approximating a Matern 3/2 kernel with some of our basis
functions,

here is an example of the algorithms in *revrand* approximating a Gaussian
Process,

and here is an example of running using our Bayesian GLM with a Poisson
likelihood and integer observations,

Have a look at some of the demo `notebooks <demos/>`_ for how we generated
these plots, and more!
