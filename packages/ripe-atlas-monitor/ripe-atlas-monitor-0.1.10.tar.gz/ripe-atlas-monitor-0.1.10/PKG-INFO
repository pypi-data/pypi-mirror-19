Description: RIPE Atlas Monitor
        ==================
        |Documentation| |Build Status| |PYPI Version| |Python Versions| |Requirements|
        
        A Python tool to monitor results collected by `RIPE Atlas`_ probes and verify they match against predefined expected values.
        
        How does it work?
        -----------------
        
        On the basis of a `RIPE Atlas`_ measurement previously created, you define a *monitor* by declaring which results you expect that probes should produce: *rules* are used to map probes and their *expected results*. Depending on whether the collected results match the expectations, custom  *actions* are performed: to log the result, to send an email, a syslog message or to run an external program.

        Status
        ------
        
        This tool is currently in **beta**: some field tests have been done but it needs to be tested deeply and on more scenarios.
        
        Moreover, contributions (fixes to code and to grammatical errors, typos, new features) are very much appreciated. More details on the contributing guide.
