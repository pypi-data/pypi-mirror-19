This is the client side of Telegram `@rpi_ip_bot <http://telegram.me/rpi_ip_bot)>`_.

This bot was designed to help you track IP-address of your Raspberry Pi 3 or any other connected device if, for some reasons, it doesn't have static IP, isn't connected to VPN and you're too lazy to scan network or get into router control panel every time you need to get the remote access to your Linux device.
