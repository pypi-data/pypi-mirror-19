Description: sanctuary
        =========
        
        Managed machine-learning model training tool based on

        The goal: help efficiently find good models via managed experiments.
        
        Status:
        
        -  trying to write down the vision and scope of the project
        -  a few callbacks for integration of Keras with Sacred
        -  an "egg" of a backend to provide results from MongoDB via REST API
        
        See the `wiki <https://github.com/bzamecnik/sanctuary/wiki>`__ for
        details.
