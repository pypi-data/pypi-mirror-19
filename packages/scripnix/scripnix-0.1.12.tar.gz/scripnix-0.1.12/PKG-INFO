        Replaces the old `Scripnix0 <https://github.com/yukondude/Scripnix0>`__
        project which had grown crufty and was not macOS-friendly.
        
        Motivation
        ----------
        
        Scripnix was born during my Linux server admin days when I wanted all of
        my aliases and scriplets to follow me from machine to machine. Packaging
        everything together made installing and keeping up-to-date that much
        easier. Writing it was also a bash scripting learning exercise, although
        I soon grew to loathe space-containing-filenames and all of the quoting
        that implied.
        
        As I moved more to MacOS, the BSD version of most commands clashed with
        the GNU/Linux versions that Scripnix assumed. Still wanting those handy
        aliases and scriplets on MacOS, I resurrected Scripnix, but with many
        more of the commands written in Python, and with Homebrew-supplied GNU
        versions of my favourite utilities. The Python rewrite sidestepped much
        of the silly bash quoting and syntax, and made testing practical.

        Change Log
        ----------
        
        The current version is 0.1.12. Scripnix is
        `semver <http://semver.org/>`__-ish in its versioning scheme.
        
        Scripnix is currently an alpha release, so expect many many breaking
        changes. Once ready for prime time, the major version number will jump
        to 2 to reflect that this is actually the second incarnation of
        Scripnix.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Following installation using one of the methods below, you may also want
        to run the ``install-scripnix`` command as the root user to setup the
        system-wide configuration. Any other users that also wish to use
        Scripnix should also run that command.
        
        The ``install-scripnix`` command will also suggest changes to your
        ``~/.bashrc`` or ``~/.profile`` files to persist Scripnix in your
        environment. It will also suggest changes to the ``/etc/sudoers`` file
        (vi ``visudo``) so that the Scripnix commands can be run via ``sudo``
        when necessary.
        
        Homebrew (macOS)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        On macOS, Homebrew will take care of installing any dependencies,
        including Python 3.
        
        ::
        
            brew tap yukondude/tap
            brew install scripnix
            install-scripnix
        
        PyPI (POSIX)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        On \*NIX, you will first need to install Python 3.3 (or higher) using
        your preferred method.
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install scripnix
            install-scripnix
        
        Development Setup
        -----------------
        
        1. Install Scripnix, as above, so that all of its dependencies are
           available.
        2. Create a Python 3 virtualenv for Scripnix:
           ``mkvirtualenv --python=$(which python3) Scripnix``
        3. Clone the Scripnix repo:
           ``git clone https://github.com/yukondude/Scripnix.git``
        4. Install dependencies:
           ``pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt -r requirements-test.txt``
        5. Install the project in development mode: ``./setup.py develop``
        6. Run the unit tests to make sure everything is copacetic:
           ``./setup.py test``
        7. Pour a snifter of Martell XO and light up a Bolivar Belicoso.
