        ``Seafoam`` is a theme for `Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/>`_,
        a static site generator written in Python.
        
        The ``Seafoam`` theme is based on Bootstrap 3, and was first used at
        `Minchin.ca <http://minchin.ca>`_. 
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The easiest way to install the ``Seafoam`` theme is through the use
        of pip. This will also install the required dependencies automatically.
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
          pip install seafoam
        
        Then, in your ``pelicanconf.py`` file, import the modele, use the
        built in function to specify your theme location, set the default
        colour scheme (more options coming soon), add the required plugins, and set
        the image processing patterns used:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          import seafoam
        
          THEME = seafoam.get_path()
          BOOTSTRAP_THEME = 'minchindotca'
        
          PLUGINS = ['minchin.pelican.jinja_filters',
                     'minchin.pelican.plugins.image_process',
                     # others, as desired...
                     ]
        
          IMAGE_PROCESS = {
            'article-feature': ["scale_in 848 848 True"],
            'index-feature': ["scale_in 263 263 True"],
          }
        
          # the rest of the your configuration file...
        
        
        You will may also need to configure the theme through the use of additional
        settings (see below).
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        ``Seafoam`` requires Pelican and the ``image_process`` and
        the ``jinja filters`` plugin. If the theme is installed from pip, these
        should be automatically installed. If needed they can be manually
        installed with pip:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
           pip install pelican
           pip install minchin.pelican.plugins.image_process
           pip install minchin.pelican.jinja_filters
        
        
        Additional Settings
        ===================
        
        Details coming. In the meantime, refer to the settings on the `Bootstrap 3
        theme <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/pelican-bootstrap3>`_.
