# py-seq-tools
Free python libraries for working with biological sequences, alignments, and formats.  

These libraries are part of Au-public scripts, I haven't documented them well yet.  The goal here is to put them into a package and get them better documented.  

Longer term, these were written in python 2, but it would be nice to either support python3 full compatability or to completely migrate them over to python3.
