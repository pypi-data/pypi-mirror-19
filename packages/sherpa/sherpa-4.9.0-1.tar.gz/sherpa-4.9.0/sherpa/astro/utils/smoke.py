    Run the smoke tests.

    A smoke test is a small set of tests designed to verify that the installation does not have
    any obvious issues.

    Parameters
    ----------
    verbosity : non-negative int
        Set verbosity level: the higher the level, the more verbose the test. This
        parameter is passed to the unittest TextTestRunner class.
        require_failure boolean. For debugging purposes, the test may be required to always fail.

    fits : basestring
        The string representing the FITS backend module to require. If the module cannot be imported,
        the smoke test will fail. However, the other tests will keep running, although they may be skipped if they
        require the FITS backend.

    xspec : boolean
        Whether the xspec module is required. If the xspec module cannot be imported, the smoke test will
        fail. However, the other tests will keep running, although they may be skipped if they require xspec.

    Returns
    -------
    The function will exit with a non-zero exit status if any errors are detected.

    Smoke test test case.

    Historically, CIAO software has been accompanied by "smoke tests", tests that are shipped with the
    main code distribution and that can be run to assess whether the software was properly installed.

    The Smoke Test is not a full tests suite, but simply tries to detect obvious failures that signal an
    improper setup.

    This class implements the Smoke Test as a standalone unittest test case. This means that there are no
    external dependencies required for the Smoke Test to run, and the only data files it may use are shipped
    with the main distribution as well.

    It is also run as part fo the full Sherpa tests suite.

    Some methods require external dependencies. If such dependencies are not found the tests are skipped.

    There is more logic (see the run method in this module) that checks the requirements are actually installed
    and fails the Smoke Test if they are not.
