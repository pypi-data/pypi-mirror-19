Description: **simple-imshow**
        #################
        
        
        **What it does:**
        
        Reads and displays an image from a url, local filename, PIL image object, `numpy.ndimage object`, or any object type scipy.misc.imread supports directly.
        Also contains an `simread` function that will return the image as a `numpy.ndarray`.
        
        I've had to look up how to display an image in this context or that too many
        times.  This is an attempt to remedy that.
        
        
        **Setup**
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install simple-imshow
        
        **Usage**
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            >> from simshow import simshow
            >> imshow('test-cats.jpg')  # display from local file
            >> imshow('http://mathandy.com/escher_sphere.png')  # display from url
        
        
        **Request for Community Support:**
        
        I'd love for others to help me make this a more
        robust, more convenient tool -- so, as the FAA likes to say, "If you see something, say something." Or at least feel free to.
        
        
        **TODO:**
        
        * Add simple tool to take a list of images and display a random sample (or all) as a grid of thumbnails.
        
        * Add support for plots.
        
        
        **Some thoughts on guidelines for this project:**
        
        * `simread` should be fast.
        
        * I'd like to keep required dependencies limited to common ones available through pip (e.g. no requirement for opencv)
        
        * It'd be nice if `simshow` could refresh quickly enough support video feeds.  In my experience matplotlib figures will not though (I do not know matplotlib well though).
