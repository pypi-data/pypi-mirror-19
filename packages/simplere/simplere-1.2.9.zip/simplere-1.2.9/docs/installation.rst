Installation
============

To install or upgrade to the latest version::

    pip install -U simplere

To ``easy_install`` under a specific Python version (3.3 in this example)::

    python3.3 -m easy_install --upgrade simplere

(You may need to prefix these with ``sudo`` to authorize installation. In
environments without super-user privileges, you may want to use ``pip``'s
``--user`` option, to install only for a single user, rather than
system-wide.)
