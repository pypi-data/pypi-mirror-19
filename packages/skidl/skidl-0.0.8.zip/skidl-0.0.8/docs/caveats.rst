Caveats
----------

Before working with SKiDL, please realize that it is still under development
and features are missing and/or likely to change.
The most notable missing feature is the lack of *back annotation* where
changes made to a circuit during PCB layout are reflected back into the
schematic (or, in our case, the SKiDL program).

Also, while SKiDL-generated netlists have been brought into KiCad's PCBNEW
layout editor and manipulated, no physical PCBs have yet been fabricated.
