Introduce
===========

Skitai is a kind of branch of `Medusa Web Server`__ - A High-Performance Internet Server Architecture.

Medusa is different from most other servers because it runs as a single process, multiplexing I/O with its various client and server connections within a single process/thread.

Skitai orients light-weight, simplicity  and strengthen networking operations with external resources - HTTP / HTTPS / XML-RPC / PostgreSQL_ - keeping very low costs.

- Working as Web, XML-RPC and Reverse Proxy Loadbancing Server
- HTML5 Websocket & HTTP/2.0 implemeted
- Handling massive RESTful API/RPC/HTTP(S) connections based on asynchronous socket framework at your apps easily
- Asynchronous connection pool with PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Redis

Skitai is not a framework for convinient developing, module reusability and plugin flexibility etc. It just provides some powerful communicating services for your WSGI apps as both server and client.

Also note it is inspired by Zope_ and Flask_ a lot.


From version 0.17 (Oct 2016), `Skitai WSGI App Engine`_ is seperated from this project.

If you want to run Skitai with fully pre-configured functional WSGI app engine as daemon or win32 service, install `Skitai WSGI App Engine`_.


Conceptually, Skitai has been seperated into two components:

1. Skitai App Engine Server, for WSGI apps

2. Skito-Saddle, the small WSGI container integrated with Skitai. But you can also mount any WSGI apps and frameworks like Flask.

.. _hyper-h2: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/h2
.. _Zope: http://www.zope.org/
.. _Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/
.. _PostgreSQL: http://www.postgresql.org/
.. __: http://www.nightmare.com/medusa/medusa.html



Installation
=========================

**Requirements**

On win32, required `pywin32 binary`_

.. _`pywin32 binary`: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20219/


**Installation**

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install skitai    

Another way from Git:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://gitlab.com/hansroh/skitai.git
    cd skitai
    python setup.py install


But generally you don't need install alone. When you install Skitai App Engine, proper version of Skitai Library will be installed.


Starting Skitai
================

If you want to run Skitai as daemon or win32 service with configuration file, you can install `Skitai WSGI App Engine`_.

Otherwise if your purpose is just WSGI app developement, you can run Skitai easily at console.


Basic Usage
------------

.. code:: python
  
  #WSGI App

  def app (env, start_response):
    start_response ("200 OK", [("Content-Type", "text/plain")])
    return ['Hello World']
    
  app.use_reloader = True
  app.debug = True

  if __name__ == "__main__": 
  
    import skitai
    
    skitai.run (
      mount = ('/', app)
    )

At now, run this code from console.

.. code-block:: bash

  python wsgiapp.py

You can access this WSGI app by visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

If you want to allow access to your public IPs, or specify port:

.. code:: python

  skitai.run (
    address = "0.0.0.0",
    port = 5000,
    mount = ('/', app)
  )

if you want to change number of threads for WSGI app:

.. code:: python

  skitai.run (
    threads = 4,
    mount = ('/', app)
  )


Mount Multiple WSGI Apps And Static Directories
------------------------------------------------

Here's three WSGI app samples:

.. code:: python
  
  #WSGI App

  def app (env, start_response):
    start_response ("200 OK", [("Content-Type", "text/plain")])
    return ['Hello World']
    
  app.use_reloader = True
  app.debug = True


  # Flask App*
  from flask import Flask  
  app2 = Flask(__name__)  
  
  app2.use_reloader = True
  app2.debug = True
  
  @app2.route("/")
  def index ():	 
    return "Hello World"


  # Skito-Saddle App  
  from skitai.saddle import Saddle  
  app3 = Saddle (__name__)
  
  app3.use_reloader = True
  app3.debug = True
    
  @app3.route('/')
  def index (was):	 
    return "Hello World"


Then place this code at bottom of above WSGI app.

.. code:: python
  
  if __name__ == "__main__": 
  
    import skitai
    
    skitai.run (
      mount = [
        ('/', (__file__, 'app')), # mount WSGI app
        ('/flask', (__file__, 'app2')), # mount Flask app
        ('/skitai', (__file__, 'app3')), # mount Skitai app
        ('/', '/var/www/test/static') # mount static directory
      ]
    )

Enabling Proxy Server
------------------------

.. code:: python

  skitai.run (
    mount = ('/', app),
    proxy = True
  )


Enabling API Gateway Server
-----------------------------

Using Skitai's reverse proxy feature, it can be used as API Gateway Server. All backend API servers can be mounted at gateway server with client authentification and transaction ID logging feature.

.. code:: python

  class Authorizer:
    def __init__ (self):
      self.tokens = {
        "12345678-1234-123456": ("hansroh", ["user", "admin"], 0)
      }
      
    # For Token
    def handle_token (self, request, callback):
      username, roles, expires = self.tokens.get (request.token)
      if expires and expires < time.time ():
        # remove expired token
        self.tokens.popitem (request.token)
        return callback (request)
      callback (request, username, roles)
    
    # For JWT Claim
    def handle_claim (self, request, callback):
      claim = request.claim    
      expires = claim.get ("expires", 0)
      if expires and expires < time.time ():
        return callback (request)
      callback (request, claim.get ("user"), claim.get ("roles"))
    
  @app.startup
  def startup (wasc):
    wasc.handler.set_auth_handler (Authorizer ())
    
  @app.route ("/")
  def index (was):
    return "<h1>Skitai App Engine: API Gateway</h1>"
  
  
  if __name__ == "__main__":
    import skitai
    
    skitai.run (
      clusters = {
       "@members": ("https", "members.example.com"),
       "@photos": ("http", ["photos1.example.com", "photos2.example.com"]) # for load-balancing
      },
      mount = [
        ('/', app),
        ('/members', '@members'),
        ('/photos', '@photos')
      ],
        enable_gw = True
        gw_auth = True,
        gw_secret_key = "8fa06210-e109-11e6-934f-001b216d6e71"
    )
    
Gateway use only bearer tokens like OAuth2 and JWT(Json Web Token) for authorization. And token issuance is at your own hands. But JWT creation, 

.. code:: python

  from aquests.lib import jwt
  
  secret_key = b"8fa06210-e109-11e6-934f-001b216d6e71"
  token = jwt.gen_token (secret_key, {'user': 'Hans Roh', 'roles': ['user']}, "HS256")

Also Skitai create API Transaction ID for each API call, and this will eb explained in Skitai 'was' Service chapter.


Run as HTTPS Server
------------------------

To genrate self-signed certification file:

.. code:: python

    openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -x509 -keyout server.pem -out server.pem -days 365 -nodes


.. code:: python

  skitai.run (
    mount = ('/', app),
    certfile = '/var/www/certs/server.pem' # combined certification with private key
    passphrase = 'your pass phrase'
  )


About Mount Point & App Routing
--------------------------------

If app is mounted to '/flaskapp',

.. code:: python
   
  from flask import Flask    
  app = Flask (__name__)       
  
  @app.route ("/hello")
  def hello ():
    return "Hello"

Above /hello can called, http://127.0.0.1:5000/flaskapp/hello

Also app should can handle mount point. 
In case Flask, it seems 'url_for' generate url by joining with env["SCRIPT_NAME"] and route point, so it's not problem. Skito-Saddle can handle obiously. But I don't know other WSGI containers will work properly.


HTTP/2.0
============

*New in version 0.16*

Skiai supports HTPT2 both 'h2' protocl over encrypted TLS and 'h2c' for clear text (But now Sep 2016, there is no browser supporting h2c protocol).

**As A Server**

Basically you have nothing to do for HTTP2. Client's browser will handle it except `HTTP2 server push`_.

For using it, you just call was.response.hint_promise (uri) before return response data. It will work only client browser support HTTP2, otherwise will be ignored.

.. code:: python

  @app.route ("/promise")
  def promise (was):
  
    was.response.hint_promise ('/images/A.png')
    was.response.hint_promise ('/images/B.png')
    
    return was.response ("200 OK", 'Promise Sent<br><br><img src="/images/A.png"><img src="/images/B.png">')	

.. _`HTTP2 server push`: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.2


HTML5 Websocket
====================

*New in version 0.11*

The HTML5 WebSockets specification defines an API that enables web pages to use the WebSockets protocol for two-way communication with a remote host.

Skitai can be HTML5 websocket server and any WSGI containers can use it.

But I'm not sure my implemetation is right way, so it is experimental and could be changable.

First of all, see conceptual client side java script for websocket.

.. code:: html
  
  <body>
  <ul id="display"></ul>
  <input id="mymsg" type="text">
  <button onclick='talk ();'>Submit<button>
  
  <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">  
  var wsUri = "ws://localhost:5000/websocket/chat";
  testWebSocket();
  
  function testWebSocket()
  {
    websocket = new WebSocket(wsUri);
    websocket.onopen = function(evt) { onOpen(evt) };
    websocket.onclose = function(evt) { onClose(evt) };
    websocket.onmessage = function(evt) { onMessage(evt) };
    websocket.onerror = function(evt) { onError(evt) };
  }
  
  function onOpen(evt) {doSend("Hello");}
  function onClose(evt) {log_info ("DISCONNECTED");}  
  function onMessage(evt) {log_info('evt.data');}
  function onError(evt) {log_info('ERROR: ' + evt.data));}  
  function doClose () {websocket.close();}  
  function doSend(message) {
  	log_info('SENT: ' + message));
  	websocket.send(message);
  }
  function talk () {
    doSend ($("#mymsg").val());
    $("#mymsg").val("");
  }
  function log_info (message) {
   $('<li>' + message + '</li>').appendTo ("#display");
  }    
  </script>  
  </body>


If your WSGI app enable handle websocket, it should give  initial parameters to Skitai like this,

.. code:: python
  
  def websocket (was, message):
    if was.wsinit ():
      return was.wsconfig (
        websocket design specs, 
        keep_alive_timeout = 60, 
        message_encoding = None
      )		

*websocket design specs* can  be choosen one of 4.

WS_SIMPLE (before version 0.24, WEBSOCKET_REQDATA)

  - Thread pool manages n websocket connection
  - It's simple request and response way like AJAX
  - Use skitai initail thread pool, no additional thread created
  - Low cost on threads resources, but reposne cost is relatvley high than the others

WS_GROUPCHAT (New in version 0.24)
  
  - Trhead pool manages n websockets connection
  - Chat room model
  
WS_DEDICATE (before version 0.24, WEBSOCKET_DEDICATE_THREADSAFE)

  - One thread per websocket connection
  - Use when interactives takes long time like websocket version telnet or subprocess stdout streaming
  - New thread created per websocket connection
 

*keep alive timeout* is seconds.

*message_encoding*

Websocket messages will be automatically converted to theses objects. Note that option is only available with Skito-Saddle WSGI container.

  - WS_MSG_JSON
  - WS_MSG_XMLRPC


Simple Data Request & Response
-------------------------------

Here's a echo app for showing simple request-respone.

Client can connect by ws://localhost:5000/websocket/chat.

.. code:: python

  from skitai.saddle import Saddle
  import skitai
  
  app = Saddle (__name__)
  app.debug = True
  app.use_reloader = True

  @app.route ("/websocket/echo")
  def echo (was, message, client_id, event):
    if was.wsinit ():
      return was.wsconfig (skitai.WS_SIMPLE, 60)
    if event == skitai.WS_EVT_ENTER:
      return "Welcome Client %s" % client_id
    return "ECHO:" + message

First 3 args (message, client_id, event except 'was') are essential. Although you need other args, you must position after theses 3 essential args. client_id is unique channel id for distinquishing websocket channel and it makes managing client state using global object.

.. code:: python
  
  num_sent = {}  
  
  @app.route ("/websocket/echo")
  def echo (was, message, client_id, event, clinent_name):
    global num_sent
  
    if was.wsinit ():
      num_sent [client_id] = 0      
      return was.wsconfig (skitai.WS_SIMPLE, 60)
    if event == skitai.WS_EVT_ENTER:
      return
    if event == skitai.WS_EVT_EXIT:      
      del num_sent [client_id]
      return
    num_sent [client_id] += 1
    return "%s said:" % (clinent_name, message)

Now client can connect by ws://localhost:5000/websocket/chat?client_name=stevemartine.
    
Once websocket configured by was.wsconfig (), whenever message is arrived from this websocket connection, called this *echo* method. And you can use all was services as same as other WSGI methods.


For Flask Users
``````````````````

At Flask, Skitai can't know which variable name receive websocket message, then should specify.

.. code:: python

  from flask import Flask, request 
  import skitai
  
  app = Flask (__name__)
  app.debug = True
  app.use_reloader = True

  @app.route ("/websocket/echo")
  def echo ():
    if "websocket_init" in request.environ:
      request.environ ["websocket_init"] = (skitai.WS_SIMPLE, 60, ("message", "client_id", "event"))
      return ""
    if request.args.get ("event"):
      return  
    return "ECHO:" + request.args.get ("message")

In this case, variable name is ("message", "client_id", "event"), It means take websocket's message and channel_id as "message" and "client_id" arg.

If returned object is python str type, websocket will send messages as text tpye, if bytes type, as binary. But Flask's return object is assumed as text type.


Events
``````````

Currently websocket has 2 envets.

- WS_EVT_ENTER: just after websocket configured
- WS_EVT_EXIT: client websocket channel disconnected

When event occured, message is null string, so WS_EVT_EXIT is not need handle, but WS_EVT_ENTER would be handled - normally just return None value.

If you do not want to handle any events just add 2 lines.

.. code:: python
  
  @app.route ("/websocket/echo")
  def echo (was, message, client_id, event):
    if was.wsinit ():
      return was.wsconfig (skitai.WS_SIMPLE, 60)
    if event: # ignore all events
      return
		  

Send Messages Through Websocket Directly
``````````````````````````````````````````

It needn't return message, but you can send directly multiple messages through was.websocket,

.. code:: python

  @app.route ("/websocket/echo")
  def echo (was, message, client_id, event):
    if was.wsinit ():
      return was.wsconfig (skitai.WS_SIMPLE, 60)
    if event: # ignore all events
      return
    was.websocket.send ("You said," + message)	
    was.websocket.send ("I said acknowledge")

This way is very useful for Flask users, because Flask's return object is bytes, so Skitai try to decode with utf-8 and send message as text type. If Flask users want to send binary data, just send bytes type.

.. code:: python

  @app.route ("/websocket/echo")
  def echo ():
    if "websocket_init" in request.environ:
      request.environ ["websocket_init"] = (skitai.WS_SIMPLE, 60, ("message", "client_id"))
      retrurn ''
    if request.args.get ("event"):
      return    
    request.environ ["websocket"].send (
      ("You said, %s" % message).encode ('iso8859-1')
    )


Use Message Encoding
`````````````````````

For your convinient, message automatically load and dump object like JSON. But this feature is only available with Skito-Saddle.

.. code:: python

  @app.route ("/websocket/json")
  def json (was, message, client_id, event):
    if was.wsinit ():
      return was.wsconfig (skitai.WS_SIMPLE, 60, skitai.WS_MSG_JSON)
    if event: # ignore all events
      return
            
    return dbsearch (message ['query'], message ['offset'])

JSON message is automatically loaded to Python object, and returning object also will dump to JSON.

Currently you can use WS_MSG_JSON and WS_MSG_XMLRPC. And I guess streaming and multi-chatable gRPC over websocket also possible, I am testing it.


Group Chat Websocket
---------------------

This is just extension of Simple Data Request & Response. Here's simple multi-users chatting app.

Many clients can connect by ws://localhost:5000/websocket/chat?roomid=1. and can chat between all clients.

.. code:: python

  @app.route ("/chat")
  def chat (was, message, client_id, event, room_id):    
    if was.wsinit ():
      return was.wsconfig (skitai.WS_GROUPCHAT, 60)    
    if event == skitai.WS_EVT_ENTER:
      return "Client %s has entered" % client_id
    if event == skitai.WS_EVT_EXIT:
      return "Client %s has leaved" % client_id
    return "Client %s Said: %s" % (client_id, message)

In this case, first 4 args (message, client_id, event, room_id) are essential.

For sending message to specific client_id,

.. code:: python
  
  clients = list (was.websocket.clients.keys ())
  was.websocket.send ('Hi', clients [0])
  # OR
  return 'Hi', clients [0]


At Flask, should setup for variable names you want to use,

.. code:: python
  
  if "websocket_init" in request.environ:
    request.environ ["websocket_init"] = (
      skitai.WS_GROUPCHAT, 
      60, 
      ("message", "client_id", "event", "room_id")
    )
    return ""
   

Threadsafe-Dedicated Websocket
-------------------------------

It is NOT for general serices. Please read carefully.

This spec is for very special situation. It will create new work thread and that thread handles only one  client. And The thread will be continued until message receiving loop is ended. It is designed for long running app and for limited users - firms's employees or special clients who need to use server-side resources or long applications take long time to finish and need to observe output message stream.

Briefly, it can be helpful for making web version frontend UI to controlling your backend application with jquery, HTML5 easily.

Client can connect by ws://localhost:5000/websocket/talk?name=jamesmilton.

.. code:: python

  class Calcultor:  
    def __init__ (self, ws):
      self.ws = ws
      self.p = None
      
    def calculate (self, count):
      self.p = Popen (
        [sys.executable, r'calucate.py', '-c', count],
        universal_newlines=True,
        stdout=PIPE, shell = False
      )    
      for line in iter(p.stdout.readline, ''):
        self.ws.send (line)	      
      self.p.stdout.close ()
      self.p = None
    
    def run (self, count):
      if self.p is None:
        threading.Thread (target = self.calculate, args = (count,)).start ()
        return 1
      
    def kill (self):
      if self.p:
        os.kill (self.p.pid)
        return 1
           
        
  @app.route ("/websocket/calculate")
  def calculate (was):
    if was.wsinit ():
      return was.wsconfig (skitai.WS_DEDICATE, 60)
    
    ws = was.websocket
    calcultor = Calcultor (ws)    
    while 1:
      m = ws.getwait ()
      if m is None: # client disconnected
        calcultor.kill ()
        break
                        
      if m.lower () == "bye":
        calcultor.kill ()
        ws.send ("Bye, have a nice day." + m)
        ws.close ()
        break
        
      elif m.lower () == "kill":  
        if calcultor.kill ():
          self.ws.send ('killed')	
        else:
          self.ws.send ('Error: not running')	   
        
      elif m.lower () [:3] == "run":
        if calcultor.run (int (m [3:].strip ())):
          self.ws.send ('started')	
        else:
          self.ws.send ('Error: already running')
        
      else:  
        ws.send ("You said %s but I can't understatnd" % m)


You can access all examples by skitai sample app after installing skitai.

.. code:: python

  sudo skitaid-instance.py -v -f sample

Then goto http://localhost:5000/websocket in your browser.

In next chapter's features of 'was' are only available for *Skito-Saddle WSGI container*. So if you have no plan to use Saddle, just skip.



Skitai 'was' Services
=======================

'was' means (Skitai) *WSGI Application Support*. 

WSGI container like Flask, need to import 'was':

.. code:: python

  from skitai import was
  
  @app.route ("/")
  def hello ():
    was.get ("http://...")
    ...    

But Saddle WSGI container integrated with Skitai, use just like Python 'self'.

It will be easy to understand think like that:

- Skitai is Python class instance
- 'was' is 'self' which first argument of instance method
- Your app functions are methods of Skitai instance

.. code:: python
  
  @app.route ("/")
  def hello (was, name = "Hans Roh"):
    was.get ("http://...")
    ...

Simply just remember, if you use WSGI container like Flask, Bottle, ... - NOT Saddle - and want to use Skitai asynchronous services, you should import 'was'. Usage is exactly same. But for my convinient, I wrote example codes Saddle version mostly.



Async Requests Service
------------------------

Most importance service of 'was' is making requests to HTTP, REST, RPC and Database Engines. The modules related theses features from aquests_.

You can read aquests_ usage first.

I think it just fine explains some differences with aquests.

First of all, usage is somewhat different because aquests is used within threadings on skitai. Skitai takes some threading advantages and compromise with them for avoiding callback heaven.

Usage
``````

At aquests,

.. code:: python

  import aquests
  
  def display_result (response):
    print (reponse.data)
  
  aquests.configure (callback = display_result, timeout = 3)
    
  aquests.get (url)
  aquests.post (
    url, {"user": "Hans Roh", "comment": "Hello"}, 
    callback = display_result
   )
  aquests.fetchall ()

At Skitai,
  
.. code:: python
  
  def request (was):
    req1 = was.get (url)
    req2 = was.post (url, {"user": "Hans Roh", "comment": "Hello"})    
    respones1 = req1.getwait (timeout = 3)
    response2 = req2.getwait (timeout = 3)    
    return [respones1.data, respones2.data]

The significant differnce is calling getwait (timeout) for getting response data.

PostgreSQL query at aquests,

.. code:: python

  import aquests
  
  def display_result (response):
    for row in response.data:
      row.city, row.t_high, row.t_low
  
  aquests.configure (callback = display_result, timeout = 3)
  
  dbo = aquests.postgresql ("127.0.0.1:5432", "mydb")
  dbo.excute ("SELECT city, t_high, t_low FROM weather;")
  aquests.fetchall ()

.. code:: python
    
  def query (was):
    dbo = was.postgresql ("127.0.0.1:5432", "mydb")
    s = dbo.excute ("SELECT city, t_high, t_low FROM weather;")
    
    response = s.getwait (2)
    for row in response.data:
      row.city, row.t_high, row.t_low


If you needn't returned data and just wait for completing query,

.. code:: python

    dbo = was.postgresql ("127.0.0.1:5432", "mydb")
    req = dbo.execute ("INSERT INTO CITIES VALUES ('New York');")
    req.wait (2) 

If failed, exception will be raised.


.. _aquests: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aquests

Also note you can't use meta argument at Skitai.

Here're addtional methods and properties above response obkect compared with aquests' response one.

- cache (timeout): response caching
- status: it indicate requests processed status and note it is not related response.status_code.

  - 0: Initial Default Value
  - 1: Operation Timeout
  - 2: Exception Occured
  - 3: Normal Terminated


Load-Balancing
````````````````

Skitai support load-balancing requests.

If server members are pre defined, skitai choose one automatically per each request supporting *fail-over*.

At first, let's add mysearch members to config file (ex. /etc/skitaid/servers-enabled/sample.conf),


Then let's request XMLRPC result to one of mysearch members.
   
.. code:: python

  @app.route ("/search")
  def search (was, keyword = "Mozart"):
    s = was.rpc.lb ("@mysearch/rpc2").search (keyword)
    results = s.getwait (5)
    return result.data
  
  if __name__ == "__main__":
    import skitai
    
    skitai.run (
      clusters = {        
        '@mysearch': 
        ('https', ["s1.myserver.com:443", "s2.myserver.com:443"])
      },
      mount = ("/", app)
    )
  
  
It just small change from was.rpc () to was.rpc.lb ()

*Note:* If @mysearch member is only one, was.get.lb ("@mydb") is equal to was.get ("@mydb").

*Note2:* You can mount cluster @mysearch to specific path as proxypass like this:

At config file

.. code:: bash
  
  if __name__ == "__main__":
    import skitai
    
    skitai.run (
      clusters = {        
        '@mysearch': 
        ('https', ["s1.myserver.com:443", "s2.myserver.com:443"])        
      },
      mount = [
        ("/", app),
        ("/search", '@mysearch')
      ]
    )
  
It can be accessed from http://127.0.0.1:5000/search, and handled as load-balanced proxypass.

This sample is to show loadbalanced querying database.
Add mydb members to config file.

.. code:: python

  @app.route ("/query")
  def query (was, keyword):
    dbo = was.postgresql.lb ("@mydb")    
    req = dbo.execute ("SELECT * FROM CITIES;")
    result = req.getwait (2)
  
   if __name__ == "__main__":
    import skitai
    
    skitai.run (
      clusters = {        
        '@mydb': 
        (
          'postresql', 
          [
            "s1.yourserver.com:5432/mydb/user/passwd", 
            "s2.yourserver.com:5432/mydb/user/passwd"
          ]
        )
      },
      mount = [
        ("/", app)
      ]
    )
    

Map-Reducing
``````````````

Basically same with load_balancing except Skitai requests to all members per each request.

.. code:: python

    @app.route ("/search")
    def search (was, keyword = "Mozart"):
      stub = was.rpc.map ("@mysearch/rpc2")
      req = stub.search (keyword)
      results = req.getswait (2)
			
      all_results = []
      for result in results:      
         all_results.extend (result.data)
      return all_results

There are 2 changes:

1. from was.rpc.lb () to was.rpc.map ()
2. from s.getwait () to s.getswait () for multiple results, and results is iterable.


Caching Result
````````````````

Every results returned by getwait(), getswait() can cache.

.. code:: python

  s = was.rpc.lb ("@mysearch/rpc2").getinfo ()
  result = s.getwait (2)
  if result.status_code == 200:
  	result.cache (60) # 60 seconds
  
  s = was.rpc.map ("@mysearch/rpc2").getinfo ()
  results = s.getswait (2)
  # assume @mysearch has 3 members
  if results.status_code == [200, 200, 200]:
    result.cache (60)

Although code == 200 alredy implies status == 3, anyway if status is not 3, cache() will be ignored. If cached, it wil return cached result for 60 seconds.

*New in version 0.15.28*

If you getwait with reraise argument, code can be simple.

.. code:: python

  s = was.rpc.lb ("@mysearch/rpc2").getinfo ()
  content = s.getswait (2, reraise = True).data
  s.cache (60)

Please remember cache () method is both available request and result objects.

For expiring cached result by updating new data:

*New in version 0.14.9*

.. code:: python
  
  refreshed = False
  if was.request.command == "post":
    ...
    refreshed = True
  
  s = was.rpc.lb (
  	"@mysearch/rpc2", 
  	use_cache = not refreshed and True or False
  ).getinfo ()
  result = s.getwait (2)
  if result.status_code == 200:
  	result.cache (60) # 60 seconds  

API Transaction ID
`````````````````````

*New in version 0.21*

For tracing REST API call, Skitai use global/local transaction IDs.

If a client call a API first, global transaction ID (gtxnid) is assigned automatically like 'GTID-C4676-R67' and local transaction ID (ltxnid) is '1000'.

You call was.get (), was.post () or etc, both IDs will be forwarded via HTTP request header. Most important thinng is that gtxnid is never changed by client call, but ltxnid will be changed per API call.

when client calls gateway API or HTML, ltxnid is 1000. And if it calls APIs internally, ltxnid will increase to 2001, 2002. If ltxnid 2001 API calls internal sub API, ltxnid will increase to 3002, and ltxnid 2002 to 3003. Briefly 1st digit is call depth and rest digits are sequence of API calls.

This IDs is logged to Skitai request log file like this. 

.. code:: bash

  2016.12.30 18:05:06 [info] 127.0.0.1:1778 127.0.0.1:5000 GET / \
  HTTP/1.1 200 0 32970 \
  GTID-C3-R8 1000 - - \
  "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1;) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0" \
  4ms 3ms

Focus 3rd line above log message. Then you can trace a series of API calls from each Skitai instance's log files for finding some kind of problems.


Utility Services of 'was'
---------------------------

This chapter's 'was' services are also avaliable for all WSGI middelwares.

- was.status () # HTML formatted status information like phpinfo() in PHP.
- was.tojson (object)
- was.fromjson (string)
- was.toxml (object) # XMLRPC
- was.fromxml (string) # XMLRPC
- was.restart () # Restart Skitai App Engine Server, but this only works when processes is 1 else just applied to current worker process.
- was.shutdown () # Shutdown Skitai App Engine Server, but this only works when processes is 1 else just applied to current worker process.





Request Handling with Skito-Saddle
====================================

*Saddle* is WSGI container integrated with Skitai App Engine.

Flask and other WSGI container have their own way to handle request. So If you choose them, see their documentation.

And note below objects and methods *ARE NOT WORKING* in any other WSGI containers except Saddle.


Access Saddle App
------------------

You can access all Saddle object from was.app.

- was.app.debug
- was.app.use_reloader
- was.app.config # use for custom configuration like was.app.config.my_setting = 1

- was.app.securekey
- was.app.session_timeout = None	

- was.app.authorization = "digest"
- was.app.authenticate = False
- was.app.realm = None
- was.app.users = {}
- was.app.jinja_env

- was.app.build_url () is equal to was.ab ()

Currently was.app.config has these properties and you can reconfig by setting new value:

- was.app.config.max_post_body_size = 5 * 1024 * 1024
- was.app.config.max_cache_size = 5 * 1024 * 1024
- was.app.config.max_multipart_body_size = 20 * 1024 * 1024
- was.app.config.max_upload_file_size = 20000000


Debugging and Reloading App
-----------------------------

If debug is True, all errors even server errors is shown on both web browser and console window, otherhwise shown only on console.

If use_reloader is True, Skito-Saddle will detect file changes and reload app automatically, otherwise app will never be reloaded.

.. code:: python

  from skitai.saddle import Saddle
  
  app = Saddle (__name__)
  app.debug = True # output exception information
  app.use_reloader = True # auto realod on file changed
  

Routing
--------

Basic routing is like this:

.. code:: python
	
  @app.route ("/hello")
  def hello_world (was):	
    return was.render ("hello.htm")

For adding some restrictions:

.. code:: python
	
  @app.route ("/hello", methods = ["GET"], content_types = ["text/xml"])
  def hello_world (was):	
    return was.render ("hello.htm")

If method is not GET, Saddle will response http error code 405 (Method Not Allowed), and content-type is not text/xml, 415 (Unsupported Content Type).
    
  
Access Request
----------------

Reqeust object provides these methods and attributes:

- was.request.command # lower case get, post, put, ...
- was.request.version # HTTP Version, 1.0, 1.1
- was.request.uri
- was.request.args # dictionary contains url/form parameters
- was.request.split_uri () # (script, param, querystring, fragment)
- was.request.get_header ("content-type") # case insensitive
- was.request.get_headers () # retrun header all list
- was.request.get_body ()
- was.request.get_scheme () # http or https
- was.request.get_remote_addr ()
- was.request.get_user_agent ()
- was.request.get_content_type ()
- was.request.get_main_type ()
- was.request.get_sub_type ()


Response
-------------

Basically, just return contents.

.. code:: python
	
  @app.route ("/hello")
  def hello_world (was):	
    return was.render ("hello.htm")

If you need set additional headers or HTTP status,
    
.. code:: python
  
  @app.route ("/hello")
  def hello (was):	
    return was.response ("200 OK", was.render ("hello.htm"), [("Cache-Control", "max-age=60")])

  def hello (was):	
    return was.response (body = was.render ("hello.htm"), headers = [("Cache-Control", "max-age=60")])

  def hello (was):	       
    was.response.set_header ("Cache-Control", "max-age=60")
    return was.render ("hello.htm")

Above 3 examples will make exacltly same result.

Sending specific HTTP status code,

.. code:: python
  
  def hello (was):	
    return was.response ("404 Not Found", was.render ("err404.htm"))
  
  def hello (was):
    # if body is not given, automaticcally generated with default error template.
    return was.response ("404 Not Found")

If app raise exception, traceback information will be displayed only app.debug = True. But you intentionally send it inspite of app.debug = False:

.. code:: python
  
  # File
  @app.route ("/raise_exception")
  def raise_exception (was):	
    try:
    	raise ValueError ("Test Error")
    except:    	
    	return was.response ("500 Internal Server Error", exc_info = sys.exc_info ())
    
You can return various objects.

.. code:: python
  
  # File
  @app.route ("/streaming")
  def streaming (was):	
    return was.response ("200 OK", open ("mypicnic.mp4", "rb"), headers = [("Content-Type", "video/mp4")])
  
  # Generator
  def build_csv (was):	
    def generate():
      for row in iter_all_rows():
        yield ','.join(row) + '\n'
    return was.response ("200 OK", generate (), headers = [("Content-Type", "text/csv")])   
    

All available return types are:

- String, Bytes, Unicode
- File-like object has 'read (buffer_size)' method, optional 'close ()'
- Iterator/Generator object has 'next() or _next()' method, optional 'close ()' and shoud raise StopIteration if no more data exists.
- Something object has 'more()' method, optional 'close ()'
- Classes of skitai.lib.producers
- List/Tuple contains above objects
- XMLRPC dumpable object for if you want to response to XMLRPC

The object has 'close ()' method, will be called when all data consumed, or socket is disconnected with client by any reasons.

- was.response (status = "200 OK", body = None, headers = None, exc_info = None)
- was.response.set_status (status) # "200 OK", "404 Not Found"
- was.response.get_status ()
- was.response.set_headers (headers) # [(key, value), ...]
- was.response.get_headers ()
- was.response.set_header (k, v)
- was.response.get_header (k)
- was.response.del_header (k)
- was.response.hint_promise (uri) # *New in version 0.16.4*, only works with HTTP/2.x and will be ignored HTTP/1.x


Getting URL Parameters
-------------------------

.. code:: python
  
  @app.route ("/hello")
  def hello_world (was, num = 8):
    return num
  # http://127.0.0.1:5000/hello?num=100	
	
  @app.route ("/hello/<int:num>")
  def hello_world (was, num = 8):
    return str (num)
    # http://127.0.0.1:5000/hello/100


Also you can access as dictionary object 'was.request.args'.

.. code:: python

  num = was.request.args.get ("num", 0)


for fancy url building, available param types are:

- int
- float
- path: /download/<int:major_ver>/<path>, should be positioned at last like /download/1/version/1.1/win32
- If not provided, assume as string. and all space char replaced to "_'


Getting Form Parameters
----------------------------

Getting form is not different from the way for url parameters, but generally form parameters is too many to use with each function parameters, can take from single args \*\*form or take mixed with named args and \*\*form both.

.. code:: python

  @app.route ("/hello")
  def hello (was, **form):  	
  	return "Post %s %s" % (form.get ("userid", ""), form.get ("comment", ""))
  	
  @app.route ("/hello")
  def hello_world (was, userid, **form):
  	return "Post %s %s" % (userid, form.get ("comment", ""))


Building URL
---------------

If your app is mounted at "/math",

.. code:: python

  @app.route ("/add")
  def add (was, num1, num2):  
    return int (num1) + int (num2)
    
  was.app.build_url ("add", 10, 40) # returned '/math/add?num1=10&num2=40'
  
  # BUT it's too long to use practically,
  # was.ab is acronym for was.app.build_url
  was.ab ("add", 10, 40) # returned '/math/add?num1=10&num2=40'
  was.ab ("add", 10, num2=60) # returned '/math/add?num1=10&num2=60'
  
  @app.route ("/hello/<name>")
  def hello (was, name = "Hans Roh"):
    return "Hello, %s" % name
	
  was.ab ("hello", "Your Name") # returned '/math/hello/Your_Name'
 

Access Environment Variables
------------------------------

was.env is just Python dictionary object.

.. code:: python

  if "HTTP_USER_AGENT" in was.env:
    ...
  was.env.get ("CONTENT_TYPE")


Jinja2 Templates Engine
--------------------------

Although You can use any template engine, Skitai provides was.render() which uses Jinja2_ template engine. For providing arguments to Jinja2, use dictionary or keyword arguments.

.. code:: python
  
  return was.render ("index.html", choice = 2, product = "Apples")
  
  #is same with:
  
  return was.render ("index.html", {"choice": 2, "product": "Apples"})
  
  #BUT CAN'T:
  
  return was.render ("index.html", {"choice": 2}, product = "Apples")


Directory structure sould be:

- /project_home/app.py
- /project_home/templates/index.html


At template, you can use all 'was' objects anywhere defautly. Especially, Url/Form parameters also can be accessed via 'was.request.args'.

.. code:: html
  
  {{ was.cookie.username }} choices item {{ was.request.args.get ("choice", "N/A") }}.
  
  <a href="{{ was.ab ('checkout', choice) }}">Proceed</a>

Also 'was.g' is can be useful in case threr're lots of render parameters.

.. code:: python

  was.g.product = "Apple"
  was.g.howmany = 10
  
  return was.render ("index.html")

And at jinja2 template, 
  
.. code:: html
  
  {% set g = was.g }} {# make shortcut #}
  Checkout for {{ g.howmany }} {{ g.product }}{{g.howmany > 1 and "s" or ""}}
  

If you want modify Jinja2 envrionment, can through was.app.jinja_env object.

.. code:: python
  
  def generate_form_token ():
    ...
    
  was.app.jinja_env.globals['form_token'] = generate_form_token


*New in version 0.15.16*

Added new app.jinja_overlay () for easy calling app.jinja_env.overlay ().

.. code:: python

  app = Saddle (__name__)
  app.debug = True
  app.use_reloader = True
  app.jinja_overlay (
  	line_statement = "%", 
  	variable_string = "#", 
  	block_start_string = "{%", 
  	block_end_string = "}"
  )

Original Jinja2 form is:

.. code:: html
  
  {% extends "layout.htm" %}  
  {% block title %}Dash Board{% endblock %}
  
  {% for group in stat|groupby ('nation') %}
    <h1>{% block sectionname %}Population of {{group.grouper}}{% endblock %}</h1>
    {% for row in group.list  %}
      <h2>{{row.state}}</h1>
      <a href="{{ was.ab ('bp_state', row.nation, loop.index)}}">{{row.population}}</a>
      <a href="#" onclick="javascript: create_map ('{{row.state}}');">Map</a>
    {% endfor %}
  {% endfor %}

app.jinja_overlay ("%", "#", "{%", "}") changes jinja environment,

- variable_start_string = from {{ to #
- variable_end_string = from }} to #
- line_statement_prefix = from None to %
- line_comment_prefix = from None to %%
- block_start_string = unchange, keep {%
- block_end_string = from %} to }
- trim_blocks = from False to True
- lstrip_blocks = from False to True

Important note for escaping charcter '#', use '##', but this is only valid when variable_start_string and variable_end_string are same. Also escaping '%' which appears at first of line excluding space/tab:

.. code:: html

  % raw:
    %HOME%/bin
    <a href="#" onclick="javascript: create_map ();">Map</a>
  % endraw

As a result, template can be written:

.. code:: html

  % extends "layout.htm"
  % block title:
    Dash Board
  % endblock  
  
  % for group in stat|groupby ('nation'):
    <h1>{% block sectionname }Population of #group.grouper#{% endblock }</h1>
    % for row in group.list:
      <h2>#row.state#</h1>
      <a href="#was.ab ('state_view', row.nation, loop.index)#">#row.population#</a>
      <a href="##" onclick="javascript: create_map ('#row.state#');">Map</a>
    % endfor
  % endfor

If you like this style, just call 'app.jinja_overlay ()'. In my case, above template is more easy to read/write if applying proper syntax highlighting to text editor. 

On Flask,

.. code:: python
  
  from flask import Flask
  from skitai.saddle import jinjapatch
  
  app = Flask (__name__)
  app.jinja_env = jinjapatch.overlay (__name__)
  

For more detail, `Jinja2 Line Statements and Escape`_.

*Warning*: Current Jinja2 2.8 dose not support double escaping (##) and 'raw' line_statement but it will be applied to runtime patch by Saddle. So if you use app.jinja_overlay, you have compatible problems with official Jinja2.


.. _`Jinja2 Line Statements and Escape`: http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#line-statements
.. _Jinja2: http://jinja.pocoo.org/


Access Cookie
----------------

was.cookie has almost dictionary methods.

.. code:: python

  if "user_id" not in was.cookie:
  	was.cookie.set ("user_id", "hansroh")  	
  	# or  	
  	was.cookie ["user_id"] = "hansroh"


*Changed in version 0.15.30*

'was.cookie.set()' method prototype has been changed.

.. code:: python

  was.cookie.set (
    key, val, 
    expires = None, 
    path = None, domain = None, 
    secure = False, http_only = False
  ) 

'expires' args is seconds to expire. 

 - if None, this cookie valid until browser closed
 - if 0 or 'now', expired immediately
 - if 'never', expire date will be set to a hundred years from now

If 'secure' and 'http_only' options are set to True, 'Secure' and 'HttpOnly' parameters will be added to Set-Cookie header.

If 'path' is None, every app's cookie path will be automaticaaly set to their mount point.

For example, your admin app is mounted on "/admin" in configuration file like this:

.. code:: python

  app = ... ()
  
  if __name__ == "__main__": 
  
    import skitai
    
    skitai.run (
      address = "127.0.0.1",
      port = 5000,
      mount = {'/admin': app}
    )

If you don't specify cookie path when set, cookie path will be automatically set to '/admin'. So you want to access from another apps, cookie should be set with upper path = '/'.

.. code:: python
  
  was.cookie.set ('private_cookie', val)
        
  was.cookie.set ('public_cookie', val, path = '/')
  

  	
- was.cookie.set (key, val, expires = None, path = None, domain = None, secure = False, http_only = False)
- was.cookie.remove (key, path, domain)
- was.cookie.clear (path, domain)
- was.cookie.keys ()
- was.cookie.values ()
- was.cookie.items ()
- was.cookie.has_key ()
- was.cookie.iterkyes ()
- was.cookie.itervalues ()
- was.cookie.iteritems ()


Access Session
----------------

was.session has almost dictionary methods.

To enable session for app, random string formatted securekey should be set for encrypt/decrypt session values.

*WARN*: `securekey` should be same on all skitai apps at least within a virtual hosing group, Otherwise it will be serious disaster.

.. code:: python

  app.securekey = "ds8fdsflksdjf9879dsf;?<>Asda"
  app.session_timeout = 1200 # sec
  
  @app.route ("/session")
  def hello_world (was, **form):  
    if "login" not in was.session:
      was.session.set ("user_id", form.get ("hansroh"))
      # or
      was.session ["user_id"] = form.get ("hansroh")

- was.session.set (key, val)
- was.session.get (key, default = None)
- was.session.source_verified (): If current IP address matches with last IP accesss session
- was.session.getv (key, default = None): If not source_verified (), return default
- was.session.remove (key)
- was.session.clear ()
- was.session.kyes ()
- was.session.values ()
- was.session.items ()
- was.session.has_key ()
- was.session.iterkyes ()
- was.session.itervalues ()
- was.session.iteritems ()


Messaging Box
----------------

Like Flask's flash feature, Skitai also provide messaging tool.

.. code:: python  

  @app.route ("/msg")
  def msg (was):
    was.mbox.send ("This is Flash Message", "flash")
    was.mbox.send ("This is Alert Message Kept by 60 seconds on every request", "alram", valid = 60)
    return was.redirect (was.ab ("showmsg", "Hans Roh"), status = "302 Object Moved")
  
  @app.route ("/showmsg")
  def showmsg (was, name):
    return was.render ("msg.htm", name=name)
    
A part of msg.htm is like this:

.. code:: html

  Messages To {{ name }},
  <ul>
  	{% for message_id, category, created, valid, msg, extra in was.mbox.get () %}
  		<li> {{ mtype }}: {{ msg }}</li>
  	{% endfor %}
  </ul>

Default value of valid argument is 0, which means if page called was.mbox.get() is finished successfully, it is automatically deleted from mbox.

But like flash message, if messages are delayed by next request, these messages are save into secured cookie value, so delayed/long term valid messages size is limited by cookie specificatio. Then shorter and fewer messsages would be better as possible.

'was.mbox' can be used for general page creation like handling notice, alram or error messages consistently. In this case, these messages (valid=0) is consumed by current request, there's no particular size limitation.

Also note valid argument is 0, it will be shown at next request just one time, but inspite of next request is after hundred years, it will be shown if browser has cookie values.

.. code:: python  
  
  @app.before_request
  def before_request (was):
    if has_new_item ():
      was.mbox.send ("New Item Arrived", "notice")
  
  @app.route ("/main")  
  def main (was):
    return was.render ("news.htm")

news.htm like this:

.. code:: html

  News for {{ was.g.username }},
  <ul>
  	{% for mid, category, created, valid, msg, extra in was.mbox.get ("notice", "news") %}
  		<li class="{{category}}"> {{ msg }}</li>
  	{% endfor %}
  </ul>

- was.mbox.send (msg, category, valid_seconds, key=val, ...)
- was.mbox.get () return [(message_id, category, created_time, valid_seconds, msg, extra_dict)]
- was.mbox.get (category) filtered by category
- was.mbox.get (key, val) filtered by extra_dict
- was.mbox.source_verified (): If current IP address matches with last IP accesss mbox
- was.mbox.getv (...) return get () if source_verified ()
- was.mbox.search (key, val): find in extra_dict. if val is not given or given None, compare with category name. return [message_id, ...]
- was.mbox.remove (message_id)


Named Session & Messaging Box
------------------------------

*New in version 0.15.30*

You can create multiple named session and mbox objects by mount() methods.

.. code:: python

  was.session.mount (
    name = None, securekey = None, 
    path = None, domain = None, secure = False, http_only = False, 
    session_timeout = None
   )
  
  was.mbox.mount (
    name = None, securekey = None, 
    path = None, domain = None, secure = False, http_only = False
  )


For example, your app need isolated session or mbox seperated default session for any reasons, can create session named 'ADM' and if this session or mbox is valid at only /admin URL.

.. code:: python

  @app.route("/")
  def index (was):	 
    was.session.mount ("ADM", SECUREKEY_STRING, path = '/admin')
    was.session.set ("admin_login", True)

    was.mbox.mount ("ADM", SECUREKEY_STRING, path = '/admin')
    was.mbox.send ("10 data has been deleted", 'warning')

SECUREKEY_STRING needn't same with app.securekey. And path, domain, secure, http_only args is for session cookie, you can mount any named sessions or mboxes with upper cookie path and upper cookie domain. In other words, to share session or mbox with another apps, path should be closer to root (/).

.. code:: python

  @app.route("/")
  def index (was):	 
    was.session.mount ("ADM", SECUREKEY_STRING, path = '/')
    was.session.set ("admin_login", True)

Above 'ADM' sesion can be accessed by all mounted apps because path is '/'.
    
Also note was.session.mount (None, SECUREKEY_STRING) is exactly same as mounting default session, but in this case SECUREKEY_STRING should be same as app.securekey.

mount() is create named session or mbox if not exists, exists() is just check wheather exists named session already.

.. code:: python

  if not was.session.exists (None):
    return "Your session maybe expired or signed out, please sign in again"
      
  if not was.session.exists ("ADM"):
    return "Your admin session maybe expired or signed out, please sign in again"


File Upload
---------------

.. code:: python
  
  FORM = """
    <form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="submit-hidden" value="Genious">   
    <p></p>What is your name? <input type="text" name="submit-name" value="Hans Roh"></p>
    <p></p>What files are you sending? <br />
    <input type="file" name="file">
    </p>
    <input type="submit" value="Send"> 
    <input type="reset">
  </form>
  """
  
  @app.route ("/upload")
  def upload (was, *form):
    if was.request.command == "get":
      return FORM
    else:
      file = form.get ("file")
      if file:
        file.save ("d:\\var\\upload", dup = "o") # overwrite
			  
'file' object's attributes are:

- file.path: temporary saved file full path
- file.name: original file name posted
- file.size
- file.mimetype
- file.remove ()
- file.save (into, name = None, mkdir = False, dup = "u")

  * if name is None, used file.name
  * dup: 
    
    + u - make unique (default)
    + o - overwrite


App and Method Decorators and was.g
-----------------------------------------

Method decorators called automatically when each method is requested in a app.

.. code:: python

  @app.before_request
  def before_request (was):
    if not login ():
      return "Not Authorized"
  
  @app.finish_request
  def finish_request (was):
    was.g.user_id    
    was.g.user_status
    ...
  
  @app.failed_request
  def failed_request (was, exc_info):
    was.g.user_id    
    was.g.user_status
    ...
  
  @app.teardown_request
  def teardown_request (was):
    was.g.resouce.close ()
    ...
  
  @app.route ("/view-account")
  def view_account (was, userid):
    was.g.user_id = "jerry"
    was.g.user_status = "active"
    was.g.resouce = open ()
    return ...

For this situation, 'was' provide was.g that is empty class instance. was.g is valid only in current request. After end of current request.

If view_account is called, Saddle execute these sequence:

.. code:: python
  
  try:
    try: 
      content = before_request (was)
      if content:
        return content
      content = view_account (was, *args, **karg)
      
    except:
      content = failed_request (was, sys.exc_info ())
      if content is None:
      	raise
      
    else:
      finish_request (was)

  finally:
    teardown_request (was)
  
  return content
    
Be attention, failed_request's 2nd arguments is sys.exc_info (). Also finish_request and teardown_request (NOT failed_request) should return None (or return nothing). 

If you handle exception with failed_request (), return custom error content, or exception will be reraised and Saddle will handle exception.

*New in version 0.14.13*

.. code:: python

 @app.failed_request
  def failed_request (was, exc_info):
    # releasing resources
    return was.response (
    	"501 Server Error", 
    	was.render ("err501.htm", msg = "We're sorry but something's going wrong")
    )
    
Also there're another kind of decorator group, App decorators.

.. code:: python

  @app.startup
  def startup (wasc):
    logger = wasc.logger.get ("app")
    # OR
    logger = wasc.logger.make_logger ("login", "daily")
    config = wasc.config
    wasc.register ("loginengine", SNSLoginEngine (logger))
    wasc.register ("searcher", FulltextSearcher (wasc.numthreads))    
  
  @app.onreload  
  def onreload (wasc):
    wasc.loginengine.reset ()
  
  @app.shutdown    
  def shutdown (wasc):
    wasc.searcher.close ()
        
    wasc.unregister ("loginengine")
    wasc.unregister ("searcher")
  
'wasc' is Python Class object of 'was', so mainly used for sharing Skitai server-wide object via was.object.

And you can access numthreads, logger, config from wasc.

As a result, myobject can be accessed by all your current app functions even all other apps mounted on Skitai.

.. code:: python
  
  # app mounted to 'abc.com/members'
  @app.route ("/")
  def index (was):
    was.loginengine.get_user_info ()
    was.searcher.query ("ipad")
  
  # app mounted to 'abc.com/register'
  @app.route ("/")
  def index (was):
    was.loginengine.check_user_to ("facebook")
    was.searcher.query ("ipad")
  
  # app mounted to 'def.com/'
  @app.route ("/")
  def index (was):
    was.searcher.query ("news")

*Note:* The way to mount with host, see *'Mounting With Virtual Host'* chapter below.

It maybe used like plugin system. If a app which should be mounted loads pulgin-like objects, theses can be used by Skitai server wide apps via was.object1, was.object2,...

These methods will be called,

1. startup: when app imported on skitai server started
2. onreload: when app.use_reloader is True and app is reloaded
3. shutdown: when skitai server is shutdowned
  

WWW-Authenticate
-------------------

*Changed in version 0.15.21*

  - removed app.user and app.password
  - add app.users object has get(username) methods like dictionary  

Saddle provide simple authenticate for administration or perform access control from other system's call.

Authentication On Entire App
```````````````````````````````

.. code:: python

  app = Saddle (__name__)
  
  app.authorization = "digest"
  app.realm = "Partner App Area of mysite.com"
  app.users = {"app": ("iamyourpartnerapp", 0, {'role': 'root'})}
  app.authenticate = True
	
  @app.route ("/hello/<name>")
  def hello (was, name = "Hans Roh"):
    return "Hello, %s" % name

If app.authenticate is True, all routes of app require authorization (default is False).


Authentication On Specific Methods Only
`````````````````````````````````````````

Otherwise you can make some routes requirigng authorization like this:

.. code:: python

  # False is default, you can omit this line
  app.authenticate = False
 
  @app.route ("/hello/<name>", authenticate = True)
  def hello (was, name = "Hans Roh"):
    return "Hello, %s" % name


User Collection
`````````````````

The return of app.users.get (username) can be:

  - (str password, boolean encrypted, obj userinfo)
  - (str password, boolean encrypted)
  - str password

If you use encrypted password, you should use digest authorization and password should encrypt by this way:

.. code:: python
  
  from hashlib import md5
  
  encrypted_password = md5 (
  	("%s:%s:%s" % (username, realm, password)).encode ("utf8")
  ).hexdigest ()

		
If authorization is successful, app can access username and userinfo vi was.request.user.

  - was.request.user.name
  - was.request.user.realm
  - was.request.user.info
  

If your server run with SSL, you can use app.authorization = "basic", otherwise recommend using "digest" for your password safety.


Building for Larger App
-------------------------

You have 2 options for extending your app scale.

1. Mount multiple microservices
2. Mount saddlery on saldde

Mount Multiple Microservices
``````````````````````````````

I personally recommend this way by current developing trend.

.. code:: python
  
  import skitai    
  
  skitai.run (
    mount = [
      ('/service', ('/service/app', 'app')),
      ('/service/trade', ('/service/trade/app', 'app')),
      ('/service/intro', ('/service/intro/app', 'app')),
      ('/service/admin', ('/service/admin/app', 'app')),
      ('/', '/service/static')
    ]
  )

And your pysical directory structure is,

.. code:: bash

  /service/app.py
  /service/templates/*.html
  /service/apppackages/*.py
  
  /service/trade/app.py
  /service/trade/templates/*.html  
  /service/trade/apppackages/*.py
  
  /service/intro/app.py
  /service/intro/templates/*.html
  /service/intro/apppackages/*.py
  
  /service/admin/app.py
  /service/admin/templates/*.html
  /service/admin/apppackages/*.py
  
  /service/static/images
  /service/static/js
  /service/static/css
  
This structure make highly focus on each microservices and make easy to move or apply scaling by serivce traffic increment.

Mount Saddlery On Saddle
``````````````````````````

If your app is very large or want to manage codes by categories, you can seperate your app.

admin.py
  
.. code:: python

  from skitai.saddle import Saddlery
  part = Saddlery ()
  
  @part.route ("/<name>")
  def hello (was):
    # can build other module's method url
    return was.ab ("index", 1, 2) 

app.py

.. code:: python

  from skitai.saddle import Saddle
  from . import admin
  
  app = Saddle (__name__)
  app.debug = True
  app.use_reloader = True  
  app.mount ("/admin", admin, "part")
  
  @app.route ("/")
  def index (was, num1, num2):  
    return was.ab ("hello", "Hans Roh") # url building
        
Now, hello function's can be accessed by '/[app mount point]/admin/Hans_Roh'.
  
App's configs like debug & use_reloader, etc, will be applied to packages except decorators.

*Note:* was.app is always main Saddle app NOT current Saddlery sub app.

Saddlery can have own sub saddlery and decorators.

.. code:: python
  
  from skitai.saddle import Saddlery
  from . import admin_sub
  
  part = Saddlery () # mount point
  # Saddlery also can have sub Saddlery
  part.mount ("/admin/sub", admin_sub, "app")
  
  @part.startup
  def startup (wasc):
    wasc.register ("loginengine", SNSLoginEngine ())
    wasc.register ("searcher", FulltextSearcher ())    
  
  @part.shutdown    
  def shutdown (wasc):
    wasc.searcher.close ()
        
    wasc.unregister ("loginengine")
    wasc.unregister ("searcher")
    
  @part.before_request
  def before_request (was):
    if not login ():
      return "Not Authorized"
  
  @part.teardown_request
  def teardown_request (was):
    was.g.resouce.close ()
    ...
  
  @part.route ("/<name>")
  def hello (was):
    # can build other module's method url
    return was.ab ("index", 1, 2) 

In this case, app and sub-app's method decorators are nested executed in this order.

.. code:: python

  app.before_request()
    sub-app.before_request()
      hello()
    sub-app.finish_request() or package.failed_request()
    sub-app.teardown_request ()
  app.finish_request() or app.failed_request()
  app.teardown_request ()


**Saddlery and Jinja2 Templates**

was.render (template_path) always find templates directory where app.py exists, even if admin.py is located in sub directory with package form. This is somewhat conflicated but I think it's more easier way to maintain template files and template include policy. Remeber one app can have one templates directoty. But you can seperate into templates files by sub directory. For example:

.. code:: python

  /app.py
  /admin.py
  /members/__init__.py
  /static
  /templates/includes/header.html  
  /templates/includes/footer.html
  /templates/app/index.html  
  /templates/admin/index.html
  /templates/members/index.html

But if you want to use independent templates under own templates directory:

.. code:: python

  from skitai.saddle import Saddlery
  
  part = Saddlery (__name__)
  
  @part.route ("/<name>")
  def hello (was):
    return was.render2 ("show.htm", name = name)


Implementing XMLRPC Service
-----------------------------

Client Side:

.. code:: python

  import aquests
      
  stub = aquests.rpc ("http://127.0.0.1:5000/rpc")
  stub.add (10000, 5000)  
  fetchall ()
  
Server Side:

.. code:: python

  @app.route ("/add")
  def index (was, num1, num2):  
    return num1 + num2

Is there nothing to diffrence? Yes. Saddle app methods are also used for XMLRPC service if return values are XMLRPC dumpable.


Implementing gRPC Service
-----------------------------

Client Side:

.. code:: python
  
  import aquests
  import route_guide_pb2
  
  stub = aquests.grpc ("http://127.0.0.1:5000/routeguide.RouteGuide")
  point = route_guide_pb2.Point (latitude=409146138, longitude=-746188906)
  stub.GetFeature (point)
  aquests.fetchall ()
  
  
Server Side:

.. code:: python
  
  import route_guide_pb2
  
  @app.route ("/GetFeature")
  def GetFeature (was, point):
    feature = get_feature(db, point)
  if feature is None:
    return route_guide_pb2.Feature(name="", location=point)
  else:
    return feature

  if __name__ == "__main__":
    skitai.run (
      mount = [('/routeguide.RouteGuide', app)
    )

For more about gRPC and route_guide_pb2, go to `gRPC Basics - Python`_.

Note: I think I don't understand about gRPC's stream request and response. Does it means chatting style? Why does data stream has interval like GPS data be handled as stream type? If it is chat style stream, is it more efficient that use proto buffer on Websocket protocol? In this case, it is even possible collaborating between multiple gRPC clients.

.. _`gRPC Basics - Python`: http://www.grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/python.html


Logging and Traceback
------------------------

If Skitai run with -v option, app and exceptions are displayed at your console, else logged at files.

.. code:: python
  
  @app.route ("/")
  def sum ():  
    was.log ("called index", "info")    
    try:
      ...
    except:  
    	was.log ("exception occured", "error")
    	was.traceback ()
    was.log ("done index", "info")

Note inspite of you do not handle exception, all app exceptions will be logged automatically by Saddle. And it includes app importing and reloading exceptions.

- was.log (msg, category = "info")
- was.traceback (id = "") # id is used as fast searching log line for debug, if not given, id will be *Global transaction ID/Local transaction ID*


Project Purpose
===================

Skitai App Engine's original purpose is to serve python fulltext search engine Wissen_ which is my another pypi work. And I found that it is possibly useful for building and serving websites.

Anyway, I am modifying my codes to optimizing for enabling service on Linux machine with relatvely poor H/W (ex. AWS_ t2.nano instance) and making easy to auto-scaling provided cloud computing service like AWS_.

If you need lots of outside http(s) resources connecting jobs and use PostgreSQL, it might be worth testing and participating this project.

Also note it might be more efficient that circumstance using `Gevent WSGI Server`_ + Flask. They have well documentation and already tested by lots of users.
