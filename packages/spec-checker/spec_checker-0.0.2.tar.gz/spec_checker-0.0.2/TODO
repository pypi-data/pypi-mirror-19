- feature: reading of source files from paths / URLs
- feature: add detection of requirements in design doc which do not exist in requirements doc
           (noticed this can go undetected in the traceability tables)
- testing: add unit tests to cover the errors detected up to now
- cleanup: refactor the requirement/design file reading methods
           so that we can reduce max-complexity to 10 again
