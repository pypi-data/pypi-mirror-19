This is a UCL branch and port of the original Sphinx software to using modern python libraries, including petlib for cryptography and msgpack for binary formats. It also decouples the message processing from other concerns to allow sphix to be embedded into other applications. It is based on the original software by Ian Goldberg (U. Waterloo) and retains both his copyright and the original LGPL licence.
