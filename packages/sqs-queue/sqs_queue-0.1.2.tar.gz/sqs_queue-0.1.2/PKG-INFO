Description: py-sqs-queue
        ============
        
        Simple Python AWS SQS queue consumer and publisher
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``python setup.py install``
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        ::
        
            from sqs_queue import Queue
        
            my_queue = Queue('YOUR_QUEUE_NAME')
            for message in my_queue:
                process(message)
        
        Or, if you'd like to leave unprocessable messages in the queue to be
        retried again later:
        
        ::
        
            for message in my_queue:
                try:
                    process(message)
                except RetryableError:
                    message.defer()
                except Exception as e:
                    logger.warn(e)
        
        And, you can publish to the queue as well:
        
        ::
        
            queue.publish('This is the body of my message.')
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        
        Behind the scenes, the generator is polling SQS for new messages. When
        the queue is empty, that call will wait up to 20 seconds for new
        messages, and if it times outÂ before any arrive it will sleep for 40
        seconds before trying again. Those time intervals are configurable:
        
        ::
        
            queue = Queue('YOUR_QUEUE_NAME', poll_wait=20, poll_sleep=40)
