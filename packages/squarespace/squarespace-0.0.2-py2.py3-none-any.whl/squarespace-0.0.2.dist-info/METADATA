# squarespace-python

Python module to access the Squarespace Commerce API.

This library provides pythonic access to the Squarespace Commerce API that
can be found here:

    http://developers.squarespace.com/commerce-api

At the time of this writing this API is in private beta and therefore
your store may not have the ability to generate API keys.

## Usage

    from squarespace import Squarespace

    store = Squarespace('<my_api_key_that_I_generated>')
    for order in store.orders(): # Iterate through 20 orders
        print(order['order_number'])
    for order in store.next_page(): # Iterate through another 20 orders
        print(order['order_number'])

## Installation

    `$ pip install squarespace`
