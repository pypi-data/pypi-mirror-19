        Requirements
        ============
        
        Scripts require dictzip to compress dictionaries. You can get it from 
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/dict/
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can either clone the git repositry and run the scripts from it or install
        using pip::
        
            pip install stardicter
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        The main script is ``sdgen.py``, it downloads and generates StarDict
        dictionaries. Check it's help for more information.
        
        Additionally there are some helper script which directly generate tarballs with
        dictionary.
        
        Generating dictionary from dicts.info
        =====================================
        
        The http://dicts.info/ server provides downloadable dictionaries for many
        languages. Unfortunately the license does not allow redistribution, so you need
        to generate them yourself. With stardicter it is easy:
        
            ./dicts_info_tarball.sh italian czech
        
        This generates tarball with italian-czech dictionary. You can choose any
        language provided by the service.
