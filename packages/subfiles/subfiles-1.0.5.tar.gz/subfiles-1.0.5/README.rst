The package introduces ``subtypes`` command to extract **subtypes of files** in a directory, so as to have a list of file extensions appearing in directory for any purpose.

The idea here is that our file extensions don't have to end with one dot, and we can create multi-level namespaces for file extensions for all kind of uses based on dot notation. There are many potential uses. For example, you might want to use secondary level extensions represent and map files with schemas of data instances that they contain. Why this matters for all data - https://youtu.be/KawiP8XBgtE ?

So, ``.subtypes`` is supposed to just contain any metadata that file extensions carry beyond what the file extension represents. For example, it could be a specific format of the CSV, or anything whatsoever, that helps any other programs or humanst to understand the files in project, such as:

Purpose
-------

Extracts subtypes of files in a directory, so as to have a list of file extensions appearing in directory.

Usage
-----

Set up::

    $ pip install subfiles

In any project, or directory, run::

    $ subtypes -l

This will output files grouped by different file sub-extensions in the project.

To start defining schemas for files with some filetypes, do::

    $ subtypes -l > .subtypes

Then, edit the generated ``.subtypes`` file to suit your needs, in the following format:

.. code::

   [.city.csv] - SHORT DESCRIPTION
   MORE INFORMATION

   [.observation.json] - SHORT DESCRIPTION
   MORE INFORMATION
