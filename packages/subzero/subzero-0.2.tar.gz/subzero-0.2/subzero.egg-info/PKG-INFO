Description: subzero
        =======
        
        |build status| |Codecov| ## What is Subzero?
        
        Subzero allows you to rapidly deploy your
        `frozen <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/shipping/freezing/>`__
        Python application with minimal effort and additional code. Subzero does
        this by providing a simple and intuitive wrapper for PyInstaller coupled
        with an MSI builder. With a few lines of code and a single command, you
        can go directly from Python code to a compiled MSI installer. In
        addition, Subzero does not require any non-Python dependencies beyond
        those required by PyInstaller, making it trivial to install.
        
        How do I install it?
        --------------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install subzero
        
        How do I use it?
        ----------------
        
        In your setup file, replace the default setup import with the followng:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from subzero import setup, Executable
        
        Then run the following command:
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py bdist_msi
        
        That's it! PyInstaller will build all of the entry points and scripts
        specified in your executable.
        
        How do I specify options?
        -------------------------
        
        In your setup function, you can specify PyInstaller options as follows:
        
        .. code:: python
        
              setup(...
                    options={
            '         build_exe': {
                          'hiddenimports': [],
                          'pathex': [],
                          'datas': [],
                      },
                      'bdist_msi': {
                          'upgrade_code': '{66620F3A-DC3A-11E2-B341-002219E9B01E}',
                          'shortcuts': [
                              'ProgramMenuFolder\Hello World = my_project'
                          ],
                      }
              ...)
        
        In addition, options can be specified on a per-executable basis
        replacing each script or entry point with an instance of the Executable
        class and initializing it with the required options, as shown below:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            setup(...
                  entry_points={
                      'console_scripts': [
                          'my_project = hello_world.__main__:main',
                          Executable('gui = hello_world.__main__:gui', icon_file='Sample.ico', windowed=False),
                      ]
                  },
            ...)
        
        The full array of options for build\_exe is available in the PyInstaller
        documentation. Providing an upgrade code is **strongly recommended** for
        the bdist\_msi command. A license agreement will be added to the
        installer if there is a license text file in the same directory as
        setup.py.
        
        Note that Subzero currently cannot create shortcuts that are not placed
        in a root system directory. In other words, you can currently have a
        shortcut on the desktop of in the program menu but not in a folder on
        the desktop or in a folder on the program menu. This may be resolved in
        the future if there is greater interest.
        
        Cython (currently not in tests)
        -------------------------------
        
        Cython modules can also be built because Subzero executes the builtin
        ``build`` command before calling PyInstaller. The following is an
        example setup.py file for a Cython project:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from setuptools import find_packages, Extension
            from subzero import setup
        
            setup(
                name='hello_world',
                author='test_author',
                version='0.1.0',
                packages=find_packages(),
                entry_points={
                  'console_scripts': [
                      'my_project = hello_world.__main__:main',
                  ]
                },
                options={},
                install_requires=[],
                setup_requires=[
                    'setuptools>=18.0',
                    'cython',
                ],
                ext_modules=[
                    Extension(
                        'my_module',
                        sources=['my_module.pyx'],
                    )
                ])
