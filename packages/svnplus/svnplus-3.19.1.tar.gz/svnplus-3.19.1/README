THIS PYTHON PACKAGE IS A hook FOR subversion AND IS NOT MEANT TO BE RUN
FROM THE COMMAND LINE UNDER NORMAL USAGE.

Very configurable, very easy to install.

Prerequisites:
        python2.7
        subversion
        apache/httpd - optional
        mod_dav_svn  - optional if apache is installed
Essentially you must have a working, accessible, subversion repository
and python installed including pip.

Install in 3 steps:
    1. pip install svnplus
    2. install the subversion pre-commit "hook"
       2.1   cd to /path/to/subversion/repo/<repo-name>/hooks
       2.2   put the file named "pre-commit", included with the module, there
             2.2.1   do not add a ".py" extension or subversion will not
                     run it.
       2.3   chown apache:apache pre-commit (or the user/group running
             subversion server daemon)
       2.4   chmod 750 pre-commit
    3. auto generate a default pre-commit.conf file (which you can then edit
       as you like).
       3.1  cd to /path/to/subversion/repo/<repo-name>/hooks
       3.2  ./pre-commit --generate > pre-commit.conf
       3.3  chown apache:apache pre-commit.conf (or the user/group running
            subversion server daemon)
       3.4  chmod 640 pre-commit.conf
       3.5  edit pre-commit.conf and follow the comments''')

SVNPlus TagProtect provides immutability (write once) protection for
the "/tags" directory of a subversion repository. This is the default
protected directory and everything is configurable.

There are two parts included with to this package, a subversion python
script named "pre-commit" and the svnplus python package.  Subversion
requires that this software be invoked with the name "pre-commit",
this is not changeable.

The "pre-commit" script can, and should, be run from the command line
for configuration testing and configuration debugging.

Installation of this subversion hook is trivial, simply put "pre-commit"
into the directory named hooks found under the directory where you
have built the subversion repository. Make sure "pre-commit" is owned
and executable by the owner of the httpd process or whatever daemon is
serving subversion.

The subversion administrator - or anyone with write permission on the
subversion installation directory - can change the configuration.

# debug value and where svn, and svnlook, have been installed
  DEBUG = 0
  SVNPATH = "/usr/bin/svn"
  SVNLOOK = "/usr/bin/svnlook"

# The remaining configuration variables comprise an N-Tuple
# and this set can be repeated as many times as wanted.
  PROTECTED_PARENT = "/tags"    # a literal path
  PROTECTED_PRJDIRS = "/tags/*" # literal, glob, or blank
  PRJDIR_CREATORS = "*"         # or comma list, or blank
  ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY = "Archive" # directory name

Do not configure directories with trailing slash characters, if you do
they will simply be discarded anyway but to avoid confusion don't add
them. The configuration of the protected project directories variable,
PROTECTED_PRJDIRS, must start with the exact same path as its associated
protected parent configuration, namely PROTECTED_PARENT. This is for
security. Also for security any instances of /../ (or the like) found
in the PROTECTED_PRJDIRS variable will be discarded.

Each TAG_FOLDER value must be unique and two(2) or more of them cannot
be subdirectories of each other. For example:

  PROTECTED_PARENT = "/tags"
  PROTECTED_PARENT = "/tags/foobar"

will not be allowed.
