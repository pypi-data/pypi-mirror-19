SWMMIO
======

SWMMIO is a set of python tools for interacting with and visualizing
results from EPA Stormwater Management Model input and output files
(.inp and .rpt). These tools are being developed specifically for the
application of flood risk management.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| SWMMIO functions by processing .inp and .rpt (input and report) files
  produced by EPA SWMM5.
| In order for these tools for work properly, an associated pair of .inp
  and .rpt files should be located within the same
| directory. SWMMIO (I think) relies only on pre-installed Python 2.7
  libraries. To optionally show basemap data, arcpy is required.
| Images2Gif was copied within this project and one line was edited to
  work herein (I need to dig to remember which).

Usage:
~~~~~~

In IDLE, add the directory holding the SWMMIO python scripts to your
sys.path variable and import the modules:

::

    import sys
    sys.path.append('/path/to/swmmio directory')
    import swmmio
    import swmm_graphics as sg
    from swmmio.utils import swmm_utils as su
    import swmm_compare as scomp

Instantiate some model objects by pointing SWMMIO to a directory
containing a model’s .inp and .rpt files:

::

    model_a = swmmio.model('/path/to/directory with swmm files')
    model_b = swmmio.model('/path/to/other/directory with swmm files')

| Create an image (.png) visualization of the model. By default, pipe
  stress and node flood duration is visualized.
| Many options can be passed to control how and what data is visualized.

::

    sg.drawModel(model_a)

Create an animated gif of a model’s response to a storm. Again many
options can be passed.

::

    sg.animateModel(model_a, startDtime='JAN-01-1990 11:59:00', endDtime='JAN-01-1990 12:01:00')

| Generate a comparison report showing changes in node flooding between
  two models. Presumably, the models
| will represent a baseline model compared to a flood mitigation
  alternative.

::

    scomp.comparisonReport(model_a, model_b)

Create visualization of the impact of a given alternative with respect
to the baseline conditions.

::

    scomp.drawModelComparison(model_a, model_b, options={'conduitSymb':'compare_hgl'})

Export organized data collected from the inp and rpt files as follows.
By default, node data is returned; optionally, conduit data can be
returned. As in all methods, a bounding box (bbox) option can be passed
to spatially filter data.

::

    model_a.exportData()
    model_a.exportData(type='conduit')

    #filter data within a bounding box
    boundingBox = ((2685990, 219185), (2692678, 223831))
    model_a.exportData(bbox=boundingBox)
