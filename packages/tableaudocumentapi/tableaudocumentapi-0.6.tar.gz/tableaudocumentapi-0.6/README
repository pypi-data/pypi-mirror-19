The Document API provides a supported way to programmatically make updates to Tableau workbook and data source files. If you've been making changes to these file types by directly updating the XML--that is, by XML hacking--this SDK is for you :)

Features include:
- Support for 9.X, and 10.X workbook and data source files
  - Including TDSX and TWBX files
- Getting connection information from data sources and workbooks
  - Server Name
  - Username
  - Database Name

  - Server Name
  - Username
  - Database Name
- Getting Field information from data sources and workbooks

We don't yet support creating files from scratch, adding extracts into workbooks or data sources, or updating field information
