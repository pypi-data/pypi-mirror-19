<p>Examples of using tdda.refererencetest.</p>

<p>To step through these examples, you should first take a copy of the
entire <code>examples</code> subdirectory, and put it somewhere else. You&#8217;ll be
making modifications to it, to see the affect of change, and you don&#8217;t
want to be modifying the originals.</p>

<p>Scenario:</p>

<pre><code>You have a python module called `generators.py`, which is responsible
for generating some HTML.

Testing that it's generated the correct HTML isn't hugely easy just
using the standard unit-testing tools on their own. You're continually
making updates to the generator code, and some of these updates will
change the output in ways that don't really matter; updating version
numbers, etc, shouldn't cause tests to stop working, but other changes
do need to be checked.
</code></pre>

<p>This examples directory contains the generators.py file, and also a unit-test
module, for testing it using tdda.referencetest. In fact there are two test
modules - one using the standard unittest framework, and the other using the
www.pytest.org pytest framework.</p>

<p>Step 1:</p>

<pre><code>Take a *copy* of the entire examples directory, if you haven't already
done so. All subsequent steps should be carried out in that copy, not
in the original source.
</code></pre>

<p>Step 2:</p>

<pre><code>Run the tests using the initial unmodified version of generators.py.

That's either:

    python unittest/test_using_referencetestcase.py

or:

    pytest pytest/test_using_referencepytest.py

The tests should all pass.
</code></pre>

<p>Step 3:</p>

<pre><code>Make a substantive change to the generation code in the generate_string
function in `generators.py` to change the HTML output. See doc strings
inside to see how to make the tests fail.

The test should then fail and suggest a diff command to run
to see the difference.

Rerun with

    python test_using_referencetestcase.py -W

or:

    pytest pytest/test_using_referencepytest.py --W

and it will re-write the reference output to match your modified
results. The files in the `reference` subdirectory will have changed
to reflect your changes to the generators.

Running the tests should now pass again.
</code></pre>

<p>Step 4:</p>

<pre><code>Make a non-substantive change (such as changing the version numbers)
in generators.py, and run the tests again (without the -W option; you're
wanting to just run  the tests, not regenenerate the expected results).

They should all still pass.
</code></pre>
