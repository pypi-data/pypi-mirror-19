`tdtools <https://bitbucket.org/padhia/tdtools>`_ is a collection of tools and utilities that I developed for my personal use. I am making these tools open-source in the hope that someone else might find them useful.

*NOTE:* These tools are not endorsed by `Teradata Inc <http://www.teradata.com/>`_.

Requirements
------------

Theses tools are tested with Python 3.4 and Python 3.5. Python 2.7 version isn't part of the testing and most likely will not work. However, if there is a strong interest in using Python 2.7 and changes required to support Python 2.7 are minimal, I may consider making selected modules support Python 2.7.

There is a dependency on `teradata <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/teradata/>`_ python package. It'll be downloaded automatically if you use standard python installer ``pip``.

Installation
------------

Use Python's standard ``pip`` utility to install ``tdtools``. ``tdtools`` can be install in an ``virtualenv``.

::

  $ pip install tdtools

Or

::

  C:\>python -m pip install tdtools

Configuration
-------------

No configuration is required except setting up the needed ODBC connections. All scripts that are part of ``tdtools`` accept arbitrary ``ODBC`` connection strings using ``--tdconn`` parameter.

If more flexibility is needed, for example, to use Teradata REST APIs, it may be done by providing ``sqlcsr_site.py`` in your ``PYTHONPATH``. Have a look at ``sqlcsr.py`` module to get an idea about what can be overriden in ``sqlcsr_site.py``.

Tools
-----

All tools are command-line utilities that are automatically installed when ``tdtools`` is installed using ``pip``. What follows is a brief description of each tool. Each tool support ``--help`` or ``-h`` command-line option that shows detailed description of options supported.

===========   =======
Command       Purpose
===========   =======
``dbtree``    Prints Teradata database hierarchy.
``vwtree``    Prints (or save) view hierarchy.
``tptload``   Generate (and optionally run on Linux) TPT load script.
===========   =======

All **show\*** utilities generate DDLs for different types of Teradata objects.

=============   =======
Command         Objects
=============   =======
``showdb``      Database or user
``showgrant``   Grants to user/role
``showprof``    Profile
``showrole``    Role
``showtvm``     Wrapper for Teradata ``SHOW <object>`` command
``showzone``    Zone
=============   =======

All **ls\*** utilities print Teradata object information from DBC tables. Currently supported commands are:

========   =======
Command    Objects
========   =======
``lstb``   Tables
``lsvw``   Views
``lsmc``   Macros
``lspr``   Stored Procedures
``lsfn``   Functions
``lsji``   Join Indexes
========   =======

Known Issues
------------

#. When using ``teradata.tdrest`` as method for database connection, certain ``show*`` commands will not work correctly. This is due to an upstream `defect <https://github.com/Teradata/PyTd/issues/52>`_. Note that this error does not occur when using ``teradata.tdodbc``, the default method for database connection.
#. SQL command ``show in xml view`` doesn't always return referenced object list. When this happens, ``vwtree`` will print an error and not display view hierarchy.

Support
-------

If you encounter an issue, report it using `issue tracker <https://bitbucket.org/padhia/tdtools/issues?status=new&status=open>`_. I'll try to provide a fix as soon as I can. If you already have a fix, send me a pull request.
