        ===========
        
        logging in colour
        
        introduction
        ============
        
        technicolor provides logging in colour and logging of function usage by
        means of a simple decorator.
        
        quick start
        ===========
        
        In the main code of the program could be a technicolor logging setup
        such as the following:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            global log
            log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
            logging.root.addHandler(technicolor.ColorisingStreamHandler())
            if self.verbose:
                logging.root.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
            else:
                logging.root.setLevel(logging.INFO)
        
        Then, in modules imported, there could be a logging setup such as the
        following:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        
        The function logging of technicolor logs the name of the function
        called, the caller of the function and the arguments of the function
        used. This functionality can be engaged by using a decorator in a way
        such as the following:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            @technicolor.log
            def function1(
                a,
                b,
                c = 4,
                d = 5,
                e = 6
                ):
                return(a + b + c + d + e)
