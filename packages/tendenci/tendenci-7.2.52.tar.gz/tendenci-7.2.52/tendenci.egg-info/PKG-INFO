        ========
        
        Tendenci is an open source content management system built for
        non-profits, associations and cause-based sites with functionality
        including association management, event registration, membership
        management, donations, payments, newsletters, CRM, and much more.
        
        Tendenci 7+ is the latest version that is compatible with Django 1.8.
        
        Important Update for Self Hosted Tendenci Sites (Posted 9.21.15)
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        
        We will be refactoring the Tendenci code starting October 1, 2015
        
        This will make it easier for you to work with the Tendenci code as a
        developer!
        
        We appreciate your participation in our community and have created
        documentation to allow you to manually update your site to the latest
        version of Tendenci
        https://tendenci.readthedocs.org/en/latest/upgrade/5.1.html
        
        After October 1, 2015 automatic updates should not be run if you are
        self hosting on Tendenci 5. Please manually update instead.
        
        You can read more about why we are making this change and further
        details on our blog: http://blog.tendenci.com/refactoring-tendenci-7-1/
        
        If you are reading this after we have removed the deprecated repos you
        can still get a copy of the old code for the various add-ons that are
        now integrated into apps by going to
        https://www.tendenci.com/download/release-archive/ but please instead go
        to https://tendenci.readthedocs.org and upgrade to the latest release.
