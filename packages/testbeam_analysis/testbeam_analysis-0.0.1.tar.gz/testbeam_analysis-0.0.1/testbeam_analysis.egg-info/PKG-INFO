Description: A simple analysis of pixel-sensor data from testbeams. All steps of a full analysis are included in one file in < 1500 lines of Python code. If you you want to do simple straight line fits without a Kalman filter or you want to understand the basics of telescope reconstruction this code might help. If you want to have something fancy to account for thick devices in combination with low energetic beams use e.g. EUTelescope. Depending on the setup a resolution that is only ~ 15% worse can be archieved with this code. For a quick first impression check the example plots in the wiki and run the examples.
