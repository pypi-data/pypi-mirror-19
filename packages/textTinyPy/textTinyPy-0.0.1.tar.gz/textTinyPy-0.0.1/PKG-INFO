Description: **textTinyPy**
        
        
        The *textTinyPy* package consists of text processing functions for small or big data files. The source code is based on C++11 and converted to Python using Cython . The package is tested on Linux and there is currently one limitation :
        
        * there is no support for chinese, japanese, korean, thai or languages with ambiguous word boundaries.
        
        The package will work properly only if both the **boost** `(boost >= 1.55) <http://www.boost.org/>`_ and the **armadillo** `(armadillo >= 0.7.5) <http://arma.sourceforge.net/>`_ libraries are installed.
