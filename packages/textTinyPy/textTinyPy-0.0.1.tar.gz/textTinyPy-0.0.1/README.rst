**textTinyPy**


The *textTinyPy* package consists of text processing functions for small or big data files. The source code is based on C++11 and converted to Python using Cython . The package is tested on Linux and there is currently one limitation :

* there is no support for chinese, japanese, korean, thai or languages with ambiguous word boundaries.

The package will work properly only if both the **boost** `(boost >= 1.55) <http://www.boost.org/>`_ and the **armadillo** `(armadillo >= 0.7.5) <http://arma.sourceforge.net/>`_ libraries are installed.
