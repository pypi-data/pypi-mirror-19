# timeTools
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/10532/blueskyjunkie/timeTools.svg)](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15797)

Python utilities relating to synchronization analysis and visualization such as time error, MTIE, TDEV and others.

PDV generation using methods such as ITU-T G.8263 are also included.

## License
GPL v3. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the details.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.4 (Python 2.7 may work but has not been tested)
- numpy/scipy
- matplotlib

It is highly recommended to use the [Anaconda distribution of Python](http://continuum.io/downloads "Anaconda distribution of Python") because to date all the necessary dependencies are included in the distribution. No additional installation necessary.

Development to date was done using Windows, but there is no particular reason why the code should not work on another OS such as Linux or OSX provided the appropriate Python distribution and libraries are installed.
