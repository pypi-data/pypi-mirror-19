        =========
        
        Update package version, build, and upload to PyPi. All in one step!
        
        
        Install
        -------
        
        trabBuild is available on PyPi. ::
        
            pip install trabBuild
        
        Or install directly from setup.py ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Navigate to the directory with the package and setup.py file you want to update and build, then type. ::
        
            $ trabbuild
        
        trabBuild will first update the version number in your setup.py file
        based on your input, then call `python setup.py sdist` and `python
        setup.py bdist_wheel --universal` to build your package.
        
        Once built you will be given the option to upload your package to
        PyPi with `twine`. *NOTE: You must already have an account on PyPi for this part to work.*
        
        ***NOTE***
        **Package version must be specified in setup.py with this format** ::
        
            __version__ = "x.x.x"
