# trackopy

## Overview

`trackopy` is a Python 3 wrapper library for the [Track-o-bot](https://trackobot.com) API.
It requires the `requests` module and Python 3.
No, it does not support Python 2.

## Installation

`pip install trackopy`

## Usage

The library relies on the `Trackobot` class.
All methods are documented and easy to use.

```
import trackopy
# from trackopy import *
# from trackopy import Trackobot
# All of the above are valid

# You can create new users if you do not already have an account
# The returned data will look like {'username': 'foo-bar-1234', 'password': 'abcdefgh'}
user = trackopy.Trackobot.create_user()

trackobot = trackopy.Trackobot(user['username'], user['password'])

# Generate a profile link
url = trackobot.one_time_auth()

# Get your stats by arena, class, or deck
stats = trackobot.stats(stats_type='decks')
stats = trackobot.stats(stats_type='classes')
stats = trackobot.stats(stats_type='arena')

# Get supported deck archetypes
decks = trackobot.decks()

# Reset your account
trackobot.reset()

# Get game history
history = trackobot.history()
arena_history = trackobot.arena_history()
```

In addition to the above, you can upload games, modify game metadata, delete games, or toggle automatic deck tracking.

I will accept pull requests.
All new functionality must be accompanied by unit tests.
