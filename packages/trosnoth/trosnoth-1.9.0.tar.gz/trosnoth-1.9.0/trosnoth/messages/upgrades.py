    Signal from interface that a buy has been requested.

    In order for everything to stay in sync, an upgrade purchase works in 3
    steps.

    1. The client sends BuyUpgradeMsg.
    2. The server checks that the stars are avaliable, and replies with
        UpgradeApprovedMsg.
    3. The client sends PlayerHasUpgradeMsg, which is then broadcast to all
        clients.

    To make launching of grenades more responsive, there is a special flag on
    Upgrade classes called doNotWaitForServer. If this flag is set, the client
    assumes that the purchase is successful unless it hears otherwise, and the
    server broadcasts PlayerHasUpgradeMsg immediately at step 2. Step 3 is not
    performed in this case.
