getting started
====

from within the vent interface (once SSH'd in) first `build` the core.  it might take a little while to download and compile everything.  once it's built you're ready to start the core from the `mode` menu option.

after starting, you should be able to go into `system info` and see that everything is running as expected.  once that looks good, you're ready to copy up pcaps.  that's it!

copy up new pcaps
====

if using docker-machine cli to provision:

```
# from the directory that contains your pcaps
# optionally add an argument of the name for vent in
#     docker-machine if you called it something other than vent
cd /path/where/pcaps/are/
vent
```

if deploying as a self-configured machine (VMWare, OpenStack, bare metal, etc.):

```
# from the directory that contains your pcaps
# optionally add an argument of the name/ip for vent on your network
cd vent
cp vent-generic /usr/local/bin/vent
cd /path/where/pcaps/are/
vent
```

otherwise edit the `ssh` and `scp` lines in `vent` specific to docker-machine and change to suit your needs

copy up new templates and plugins
====

if using docker-machine cli to provision:

```
docker-machine scp modes.template vent:/var/lib/docker/data/templates/modes.template
```

if using boot2docker cli to provision (DEPRECATED):

```
scp -r -i ~/.ssh/id_boot2docker -P 2022 modes.template docker@localhost:/var/lib/docker/data/templates/modes.template
```

if deploying as a self-configured machine (VMWare, OpenStack, bare metal, etc.):

```
scp modes.template docker@vnet:/var/lib/docker/data/templates/modes.template
```

FAQ
====

**Q**: What are the credentials to login if I don't use certificates/keys?

**A**: docker/tcuser

**Q**: I went into the shell and did a `docker ps` but no containers are running, how do I get it working again?

**A**: execute `docker rm vent-management; sudo /scripts/custom`, if that doesn't work, restart the VM.
