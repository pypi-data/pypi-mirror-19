This is the main page of your project\(aqs \fI\%Sphinx\fP
documentation. It is formatted in \fI\%reStructuredText\fP\&. Add additional pages by creating
rst\-files in \fBdocs\fP and adding them to the \fI\%toctree\fP below. Use then
\fI\%references\fP in order to link
them from this page, e.g. authors and changes\&.
.sp
It is also possible to refer to the documentation of other Python packages
with the \fI\%Python domain syntax\fP\&. By default you
can reference the documentation of \fI\%Sphinx\fP,
\fI\%Python\fP, \fI\%NumPy\fP, \fI\%SciPy\fP, \fI\%matplotlib\fP, \fI\%Pandas\fP, \fI\%Scikit\-Learn\fP\&. You can add more by
extending the \fBintersphinx_mapping\fP in your Sphinx\(aqs \fBconf.py\fP\&.
.sp
The pretty useful extension \fI\%autodoc\fP is activated by
default and lets you include documentation from docstrings. Docstrings can
be written in \fI\%Google\fP
(recommended!), \fI\%NumPy\fP
and \fI\%classical\fP
style.
