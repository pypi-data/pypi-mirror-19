WASPy
=====

Waspy is the python framework for the `WASP
project <https://github.com/wasp/wasp>`__. In other words its an
asynchronous "transport-agnostic" web framework.

Language agnostic concepts
--------------------------

While this framework is for python, the patterns used in wasp are
language agnostic. You should be able to call other services in
different languages assuming they all follow the same patterns. This
framework has a pluggable architecture for the transport layer, which
allows you to switch from http to using a message bus, or vice-versa.
You could even listen on both at the same time without having to modify
your code at all.

missing.

Features for beta: - [x]: HTTP Transport - [x]: Routing - [x]: RabbitMQ
transporty - [x]: Support middlewares - [x]: Client library (for calling
other services) - [x]: HTTP client transport (with envvar service
discovery) - [ ]: RabbitMQ client transport

Wish List: - [ ]: Transport classes for nats (nats.io) - [ ]: Transport
classes for kafka - [ ]: pattern for synchronous "worker-tier" - [ ]:
