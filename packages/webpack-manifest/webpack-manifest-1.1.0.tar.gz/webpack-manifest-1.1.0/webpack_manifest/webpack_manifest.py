Description
-----------

Manifest loader that allows you to include references to files built by webpack.

Handles manifests generated by the [webpack-yam-plugin](https://github.com/markfinger/webpack-yam-plugin).


Usage
-----

```
import webpack_manifest

manifest = webpack_manifest.load(
    # An absolute path to a manifest file
    path='/abs/path/to/manifest.json',

    # The root url that your static assets are served from
    static_url='/static/',

    # optional args...
    # ----------------

    # Ensures that the manifest is flushed every time you call `load(...)`
    # If webpack is currently building, it will also delay until it's ready.
    # You'll want to set this to True in your development environment
    debug=False,

    # Max timeout (in seconds) that the loader will wait while webpack is building.
    # This setting is only used when the `debug` argument is True
    timeout=60,

    # If a manifest read fails during deserialization, a second attempt will be
    # made after a small delay. By default, if `read_retry` is `None` and `debug`
    # is `True`, it well be set to `1`
    read_retry=None,
)

# `load` returns a manifest object with properties that match the names of
# the entries in your webpack config. The properties matching your entries
# have `js` and `css` properties that are pre-rendered strings that point
# to all your JS and CSS assets. Additionally, tuples of relative urls are
# available under `rel_js` and `rel_css` properties.

# A string containing pre-rendered script elements for the "main" entry
manifest.main.js  # '<script src="/static/path/to/file.js"><script><script ... >'

# A string containing pre-rendered link elements for the "main" entry
manifest.main.css  # '<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/path/to/file.css"><link ... >'

# A string containing pre-rendered link elements for the "vendor" entry
manifest.vendor.css  # '<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/path/to/file.css"><link ... >'

# A tuple containing relative urls (without the static url) to the "vender" entry
manifest.vendor.rel_css  # ('path/to/file.css', 'path/to/another.css', ...)

# Note: If you don't name your entry, webpack will automatically name it "main".
