        # webwol: Generate wake-on-lan packets via a web interface
        
        This script provides one-touch wake-on-lan packet generation from a web interface.
        There's not much to it. The only thing it depends on is Python (2.6+).
        
        # How To Use
        
        This script has intentionally attempted to minimize dependencies. It should run
        anywhere that has python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5 installed.
        
        ## Install It
        
        Get the code somehow:
        
        * [Download the latest release](https://github.com/fhats/webwol/releases/latest)
        * Clone this repository
        * [Download a debian package](https://github.com/fhats/webwol/releases/latest)
            * Install it with something like `dpkg -i python-webwol*.deb`
        * Copy and paste it from this repo
        * pip install it
        * Transcribe it by hand??
        
        ## Configure It
        
        Here's the magic bit. Write down the MAC addresses you want to send wake-on-lan
        packets to. Give those puppies a name, too, cause why not? Do it like this:
        
        ```
        {
            "deadbeef-dad": "de:ad:be:ef:da:dd",
            "mr-counter": "12:34:56:78:90:ef"
        }
        ```
        
        If you don't know the MAC address you want, try lookin' up how to do it on the
        [internet](http://www.wikihow.com/Find-the-MAC-Address-of-Your-Computer). There's
        another example about how to write this file [in this repo](https://github.com/fhats/webwol/blob/master/example-config.json)
        
        Save all them juicy bits in a file somewhere on the computer that webwol's gonna
        run on. You could put it in a place like `/etc/webwol.json` if you want. Or your
        homedir. I won't judge.
        
        ## Run It
        
        `python webwol.py` from the place where you downloaded the code. Or if you
        installed from a debian package, it's probably in your path, so try just `webwol.py`?
