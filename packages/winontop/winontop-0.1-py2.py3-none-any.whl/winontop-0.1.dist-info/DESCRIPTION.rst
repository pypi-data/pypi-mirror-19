Hey folks this is an easy to use tool to keep windows on top of others.
You have to specify only a part of the name in windows name.If you want a notepad, excel, word or any application to be on top while you work this is the tool you are looking for, no need to install any third party software.

For installation >> pip install winontop

If you want a chrome tab to be on top just mention any word in the title.

For eg. if you want youtube video "Game of Thrones Season 6: Episode #9 Preview (HBO)" on top 
>>> winontop thrones
or
>>> winontop games


For help doc
>>> winontop -h

Tested on Windows 10/Python2
