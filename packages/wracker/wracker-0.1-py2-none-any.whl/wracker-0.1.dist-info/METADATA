# Wracker

(PRE-ALPHA DO NOT USE) A Python clone of bundler.  The wheel racker!

## Commands

* `wracker install` installs packages from a `requirements.in` file (in your CWD
  or parent directories) and writes the specific versions to `requirements.txt`

* `wracker exec` sets `$PYTHONPATH` to use your wheel rack and sets
  `$PYTHONHOME` to an automatically created and empty virtualenv, keeping your
  project isolated from other Python projects on your machine.  The automatic
  virtualenv is set to use the same version of Python that's accessible as
  `python` on the prompt, so it works well with virtualenv and pyenv.  The
  version of Python can also be manually specified using the `-p` switch
  (although this has not been extensively tested).

* `wracker exec` also sets `$PATH` to include paths to scripts installed by your
  Python packages, so `wracker exec pep8` will launch your frozen pep8


## Todo

(Presented in no particular order.)

* [ ] Support installation with Python 3

* [ ] Support Python 3 projects

  * If it's not clear from this point and the other, wracker needs to be
    installed with Python 2, yet will only work for projects using Python 3.  I
    know.  I'm working on it.

* [ ] VCS URLs

* [ ] `-r` includes

* [ ] Verification that all versions are compatible

* [ ] Friendly errors

* [ ] Tests

* [ ] Segregate installed modules by Python version used to compile

* [ ] A million other things
