Description: # Wracker
        
        (PRE-ALPHA DO NOT USE) A Python clone of bundler.  The wheel racker!
        
        ## Commands
        
        * `wracker install` installs packages from a `requirements.in` file (in your CWD
          or parent directories) and writes the specific versions to `requirements.txt`
        
        * `wracker exec` sets `$PYTHONPATH` to use your wheel rack and sets
          `$PYTHONHOME` to an automatically created and empty virtualenv, keeping your
          project isolated from other Python projects on your machine.  The automatic
          virtualenv is set to use the same version of Python that's accessible as
          `python` on the prompt, so it works well with virtualenv and pyenv.  The
          version of Python can also be manually specified using the `-p` switch
          (although this has not been extensively tested).
        
        * `wracker exec` also sets `$PATH` to include paths to scripts installed by your
          Python packages, so `wracker exec pep8` will launch your frozen pep8
