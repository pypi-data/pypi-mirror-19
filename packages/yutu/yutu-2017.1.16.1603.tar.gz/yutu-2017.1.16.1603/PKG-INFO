        Data by Dorit Borrmann and Hassan Afzal of Jacobs University Bremen
        gGmbH was provided by the `Robotic 3D Scan
        Repository <http://kos.informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de/3Dscans/>`__. The
        data were recorded at the Automation Lab at Jacobs University Bremen
        using a Riegl VZ-400 laser scanner and an Optris PI infrared camera.
        Thermal data is encoded as colour.
        
        future
        ======
        
        Under consideration are rigid body movement matrices and perspective
        projection data cuts.
