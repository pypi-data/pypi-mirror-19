Change log
----------


Version 0.10.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released: 2017-02-02

**Incompatible changes:**

* The support for server-side filtering caused an incompatibility for the
  `find()` and `findall()` methods: For String typed resource properties,
  the provided filter string is now interpreted as a regular expression
  that is matched against the actual property value, whereby previously it
  was matched by exact string comparison.

* The parameter signatures of the `__init__()` methods of `BaseResource` and
  `BaseManager` have changed incompatibly. These methods have always been
  considered internal to the package. They are now explicitly stated to be
  internal and their parameters are no longer documented.
  If users have made themselves dependent on these parameters (e.g. by writing
  a mock layer), they will need to adjust to the new parameter signature. See
  the code for details.

**Deprecations:**

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed a bug where the CLI code tries to access 'cpc'  from the 'partition'
  directly without going via the manager property. This caused
  an AttributeError (issue #161).

* Fixed unrecognized field ('adapter-port') during 'HBA create' (issue #163).

**Enhancements:**

* Added filter arguments to the `list()` method, and added support for
  processing as many filter arguments as supported on the server side via
  filter query parameters in the URI of the HMC List operation. The remaining
  filter arguments are processed on the client side in the `list()` method.

* Changed the keyword arguments of the `find()` and `findall()` methods to be
  interpreted as filter arguments that are passed to the `list()` method.

* Documented the authorization requirements for each method, and in total
  in a new section "Setting up the HMC".

* Added a method `open_os_message_channel()` on Partition and Lpar objects,
  that returns a notification token for receiving operating system messages
  as HMC notifications.

* Experimental: Added a class `NotificationReceiver` that supports receiving
  and iterating through HMC notificationsi for a notification token, e.g.
  those produced by `open_os_message_channel()`.

**Known Issues:**

* See `list of open issues`_.

Version 0.9.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released: 2017-01-11

**Incompatible changes:**

**Deprecations:**

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed a bug where accessing the 'name' property via the `properties`
  attribute caused `KeyError` to be raised (issue #137). Note that there
  is now a recommendation to use `get_property()` or the `name` or `uri`
  attributes for accessing specific properties. The `properties` attribute
  should only be used for iterating over the currently present resource
  properties, but not for expecting particular properties.

* Fixing regression in findall(name=..) (issue #141).

**Enhancements:**

* Changed links to HMC API books in Bibliography to no longer require IBM ID
  (issue #131).

* Added example shell script showing how to use the command line interface.

* Improved the examples with better print messages, exception handling,
  access of resource properties, and refreshing of resources.

* Added support for load-parameter field in lpar.load().


Version 0.8.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released: 2016-12-27

**Incompatible changes:**

**Deprecations:**

**Bug fixes:**

**Enhancements:**

* Added support in CLI for remaining cmds; client improvements.

* Added a tool 'tools/cpcdata' for gathering information about all
  CPCs managed by a set of HMCs. The data can optionally be appended
  to a CSV spreadsheet, for regular monitoring.


Version 0.7.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released: 2016-12-08

**Bug fixes:**

* IOError during click-spinner 0.1.4 install (issue #120)

**Enhancements:**

* Documentation for zhmc CLI


Version 0.6.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released: 2016-12-07

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed typo in help message of cpcinfo.

* Fixed KeyError: 'status' when running example5.py (issue #99).

* Fixed documentation of field Partition.hbas (issue #101).

* Fixed new Flake8 issue E305.

**Enhancements:**

* Started raising a `ParseError` exception when the JSON payload in a HTTP
  response cannot be parsed, and improved the definition of the ParseError
  exception by adding line and column information.

* Improved the `AuthError` and `ConnectionError` exceptions by adding a
  `details` property that provides access to the underlying exception
  describing details.

* For asynchronous operations that are invoked with `wait_for_completion`,
  added an entry in the time statistics for the overall operation
  from the start to completion of the asynchronous operation. That entry
  is for a URI that is the target URI, appended with "+completion".

* Added time statistics entry for overall asynchronous operations.

* Improved VersionError exception class and removed number-of-args tests.

* Added the option to create a session object with a given session id.

* Added base implementation of a command line interface (zhmc)
  for the zhmcclient.


Version 0.5.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released: 2016-10-04

**Incompatible changes:**

* In ``VirtualSwitch.get_connected_vnics()``, renamed the method to
  :meth:`~zhmcclient.VirtualSwitch.get_connected_nics` and changed its return value
  to return :class:`~zhmcclient.Nic` objects instead of their URIs.

**Deprecations:**

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed that in `Partition.dump_partition()`, `wait_for_completion` was always
  passed on as `True`, ignoring the corresponding input argument.

**Enhancements:**

* Added a script named ``tools/cpcinfo`` that displays information about CPCs.
  Invoke with ``-h`` for help.

* Added a :meth:`~zhmcclient.BaseResource.prop` method for resources that
  allows specifying a default value in case the property does not exist.

* Added :meth:`~zhmcclient.Cpc.get_wwpns` which performs HMC operation
  'Export WWPN List'.

* Added :meth:`~zhmcclient.Hba.reassign_port` which performs HMC operation
  'Reassign Storage Adapter Port'.

* Clarifications in the :ref:`Resource model` section.

* Optimized :attr:`~zhmcclient.Cpc.dpm_enabled` property to use
  'List Partitions' and  'List Logical Partitions' operations, in order to
  avoid the 'List CPC Properties' operation.

* Improved tutorials.
