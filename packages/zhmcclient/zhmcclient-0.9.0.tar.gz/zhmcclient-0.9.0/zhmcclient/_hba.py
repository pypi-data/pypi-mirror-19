A :term:`HBA` (Host Bus Adapter) is a logical entity that provides a
:term:`Partition` with access to external storage area networks (SANs) through
an :term:`FCP Adapter`. More specifically, an HBA connects a Partition with an
:term:`Adapter Port` on an FCP Adapter.

HBA resources are contained in Partition resources.

HBAs only exist in :term:`CPCs <CPC>` that are in DPM mode.
