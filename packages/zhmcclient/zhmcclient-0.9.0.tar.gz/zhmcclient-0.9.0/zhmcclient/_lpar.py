A :term:`LPAR` (Logical Partition) is a subset of the hardware resources of a
:term:`CPC` in classic mode (or ensemble mode), virtualized as a separate
computer.

LPARs cannot be created or deleted by the user; they can only be listed.

LPAR resources are contained in CPC resources.

LPAR resources only exist in CPCs that are in classic mode (or ensemble mode).
CPCs in DPM mode have :term:`Partition` resources, instead.
