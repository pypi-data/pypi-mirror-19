Base definitions for resource manager classes.

Resource manager classes exist for each resource type and are helper classes
that provide functionality common for the resource type.

Resource manager objects are not necessarily singleton objects, because they
have a scope of a certain set of resource objects. For example, the resource
manager object for LPARs exists once for each CPC managed by the HMC, and the
resource object scope of each LPAR manager object is the set of LPARs in that
CPC.
