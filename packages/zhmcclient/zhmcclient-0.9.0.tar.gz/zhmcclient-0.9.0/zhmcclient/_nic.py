A :term:`NIC` (Network Interface Card) is a logical entity that provides a
:term:`Partition` with access to external communication networks through a
:term:`Network Adapter`. More specifically, a NIC connects a Partition with a
:term:`Network Port`, or with a :term:`Virtual Switch` which then connects to
the Network Port.

NIC resources are contained in Partition resources.

NICs only exist in :term:`CPCs <CPC>` that are in DPM mode.
