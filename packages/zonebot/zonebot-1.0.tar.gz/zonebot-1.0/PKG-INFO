Description: This is a Slack Bot that monitors one or more Slack channels for commands and
        interacts with a ZoneMinder system to report events and obtain information.
        
        The primary use for this bot is to allow access to some parts of a ZoneMinder
        system that is behind a firewall, without having to expose the actual system to
        the Internet. Making a ZoneMinder system available to the Internet has several
        requirements (static IP, secure system) that may not be feasible for all users.
        
        By providing a bot that can interact with both ZoneMinder and Slack, remote access to
        and notification from ZoneMinder is possible, without needing a static IP and using
        the security provided by the Slack environment.
